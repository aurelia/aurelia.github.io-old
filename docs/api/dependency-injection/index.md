# Dependency Injection Module

> A lightweight, extensible dependency injection container for JavaScript.

## Classes


### All

Used to allow functions/classes to specify resolution of all matches to a key.

#### Properties


#### Methods


* `get(container: Container): ` - Called by the container to resolve all matching dependencies as an array of instances.
  * `container: Container` - The container to resolve from.


* `static of(key: any): All` - Creates an All Resolver for the supplied key.
  * `key: any` - The key to resolve all instances for.



### Container

A lightweight, extensible dependency injection container.

#### Properties

* `parent: Container` - The parent container in the DI hierarchy.
* `root: Container` - The root container in the DI hierarchy.
