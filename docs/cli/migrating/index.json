When you are migrating an existing application from the integrated bundler to Webpack there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\nThe recommended way to migrate is to create a new Webpack application using the CLI, choosing similar technology as the project that you want to migrate. Then you would copy over the source code (in the `src` folder by default) and the unit tests (in the `test/unit` folder). After that you will have to make some changes to the codebase, which are explained below.\n\nWebpack requires the use of `PLATFORM.moduleName()` for any module reference in the code, except for the import statements. `PLATFORM` can be imported using `import {PLATFORM} from 'aurelia-pal';`.\n\nA few examples: \n- in `main.js` or `main.ts` do `aurelia.setRoot(PLATFORM.moduleName('app'))`.\n- for routes do `{ ...., name: 'users', moduleId: PLATFORM.moduleName('./users'), ... }`\n- `@useView(PLATFORM.moduleName('my-view.html'))`\n- `.resources(PLATFORM.moduleName('resources/index'))`\n- when Webpack cannot find a module even though it exists, you likely are missing a PLATFORM.moduleName for that module\n\nThe Aurelia CLI bundler gets its bundle configuration from the `aurelia_project/aurelia.json` file. This is different for Webpack, where the bundle configuration is inside `webpack.config.js`. Webpack projects created by the CLI use Aurelia's Webpack Plugin, which you'll find in `webpack.config.js`.\n\nIf you use SASS or LESS, then you are going to have to import the stylesheets differently. When you include stylesheets and use the Aurelia CLI bundler, then your `<require>` statements will have the `.css` extension: `<require from=\"styles/my-stylesheet.css\"></require>`. When you use Webpack you have to change this into the `.sass` or `.less` extension: `<require from=\"styles/my-stylesheet.sass\"></require>`.\n\n"}
