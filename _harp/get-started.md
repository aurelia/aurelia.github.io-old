# Get Started

Welcome to Aurelia! This tutorial will take you through creating a simple application using Aurelia and briefly explain its main concepts. We assume you are familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

> **Note:** To view the completed results of this tutorial, have a look at our [navigation skeleton project](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation). You may also wish to download it and simply delete the contents of the src folder in order to follow this tutorial but incur less manual setup labor. That's what we would do...

## Configuring Your Environment

Let's start by getting you set up with a great set of tools that you can use to build modern JavaScript applications. All our tooling is built on Node.js. If you have that installed aready, great! If not, you should go to [the official web site](http://nodejs.org/), download and install it. Everything else we need will be installed via Node's package manager (npm).

First, let's begin by installing [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) which we'll be using for build automation. If you don't have it already, you can use npm to set it up like this:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```

Next, we need to intsall [jspm](http://jspm.io/). This will serve as our client-side package manager. You can do that like this:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```

> **Note:** Windows users, please ensure that you are using a bash shell for the above and following shell commands.

## Setting up the Project Structure and Build

With our basic tooling in place, we can now set up a basic structure for our app. 

With those two tools in place, we want to actually install our gulp modules for building our code and our JavaScript modules for runtime.

    constructor(){
        this.variable = 'test';
    }
}
```

```markup
