# Docs

We've got a very rich set of docs planned for Aurelia. Unfortunately, we haven't quite finished them yet. During this early preview period, we're providing you with a simple "cheat sheet" containing examples of the most common tasks you might want to perform. If you have questions, we hope that you will join us on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/aurelia/discuss).
