          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">Rob Eisenberg</span> on <span class="date">March 4, 2018</span>
          <p>Last week we announced official support for Server-Side Rendering in Aurelia [blog/2018/02/25/server-side-rendering]. This week we&#x27;re announcing an update to our Webpack tooling to support Webpack 4.0! We&#x27;ve also got a number of incremental fixes and small new features for other Aurelia libraries, detailed below.</p>

          <p>Without Server Side Rendering the server returns only boilerplate HTML without any content. Today we&#x27;re announcing Aurelia Server Side Rendering which allows a Node.js server to render your application on the server and return the HTML of a fully rendered page.</p>
