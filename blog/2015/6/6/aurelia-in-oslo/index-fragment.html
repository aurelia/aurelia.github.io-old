      <p>Next week, Rob Eisenberg will be presenting at the 
<a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/" target="_blank">Norwegian Developers Conference</a>
 in Oslo, Norway. He'll be giving two presentations. The first, 
<a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-30202" target="_blank">The New JavaScript: ES6</a>
, is designed to bring you up to speed on the latest developments in JavaScript and help you catch a vision of where the language is heading in the future. The second talk, 
<a href="http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-30201" target="_blank">Aurelia: Next Generation Web Apps</a>
, will show you how a modern, ES6-based framework can make building complex JavaScript clients effortless. If you are in or around Oslo, we hope you will come and check it out.</p>
<p>Also, Core Team Member, 
<a href="http://odetocode.com/" target="_blank">K. Scott Allen</a>
, will be introducing Aurelia to the 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Oslo/" target="_blank">AngularJS Oslo Meetup</a>
