          <h3>Aurelia and Kendo UI</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">January 28, 2016</span>
          <p>Today, I&#x27;m really excited to introduce to you three innovative community members: Nikolaj Ivancic, Charles Pockert and Jeroen Vinke. They&#x27;ve been working together to create native Aurelia components for the Kendo UI suite, as well as a number of other tools for &quot;bridging&quot; the gap between existing component libraries and Aurelia. I asked them to put together a blog post that we could share with you here, announcing and explaining their work. Read on to learn more about the Aurelia UI Toolkits project.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Beta Week - Day 5 - Aurelia Interface</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 20, 2015</span>
          <p>On the final day of our beta week announcements, we wanted to leave you with a sneak peek of what we are working on for the future. One of the most common requests we&#x27;ve heard from the community is the desire for a component library. I&#x27;m happy to say, we&#x27;ve been thinking of that too...since the very beginning. We&#x27;ve dubbed our component library &quot;Aurelia Interface&quot;.</p>
