          <h3>Aurelia Beta Week - Day 5 - Aurelia Interface</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 20, 2015</span>
          <p>On the final day of our beta week announcements, we wanted to leave you with a sneak peek of what we are working on for the future. One of the most common requests we&#x27;ve heard from the community is the desire for a component library. I&#x27;m happy to say, we&#x27;ve been thinking of that too...since the very beginning. We&#x27;ve dubbed our component library &quot;Aurelia Interface&quot;.</p>

          <p>We continue our beta release week with some exciting news about our ecosystem. The Aurelia team is hard at work developing resources for all types of Aurelia users from Web Devs to Designers to CIOs. We understand the importance of having a rich ecosystem and that being able to get the information or help you need to stay productive is vital. There are also many external resources that are being developed by our excellent community. We&#x27;d like to take a few words to highlight a small portion of the work currently happening to build Aurelia&#x27;s ecosystem.</p>

          <p>When we launched the alpha of Aurelia back in February, we did so with a set of very preliminary documentation. Today we&#x27;re launching our new docs, which include an updated (simpler) getting started guide, various topical articles, a cheat sheet and a full API reference.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Beta Week - Day 2 - Plugins</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 17, 2015</span>
          <p>Yesterday, after months of work, we launched the Beta 1 release of Aurelia. From the beginning, one of the most important aspects of Aurelia&#x27;s architecture has been its modularity and its pluggable design. In light of that, we wanted to dedicate one of this week&#x27;s posts to plugins: What are they? What is available? and What are our plans?</p>

          <p>The Aurelia beta is fast approaching (as in coming next week). We&#x27;re waiting on some tooling fixes before we launch. In the mean time, we thought we&#x27;d give you an &quot;almost beta&quot; release so you can start to update your code and provide us with feedback. Read on for the details...</p>
