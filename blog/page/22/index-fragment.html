          <h3>Aurelia &amp; Angular 2.0 Code Side by Side - Part 2</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">March 17, 2015</span>
          <p>Yesterday I showed an example of Angular 2.0 code side-by-side with Aurelia [http://blog.durandal.io/2015/03/16/aurelia-and-angular-2-code-side-by-side/]. I showed the &quot;reverse binding&quot; technique for Angular 2.0. Today I&#x27;m going to show how the Angular 2.0 Forms Model [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1US9h0ORqBltl71TlEU6s76ix8SUnOLE2jabHVg9xxEA/] can be used instead. I&#x27;ll also show Aurelia next to it, so you can see the difference. Both examples will use the same Contact model.</p>

          <p>Little over a month ago, we announced the public preview of Aurelia [http://aurelia.io/]. Since then the community has exploded and we&#x27;ve seen a lot of exciting things happen. Thanks to the core team and an engaged community, we&#x27;ve made some big improvements. We&#x27;ve still got a way to go yet, but the future looks great. Below we&#x27;ll update you on what&#x27;s happened in the last month as well as let you know what to expect next.</p>
