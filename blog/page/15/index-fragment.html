          <p>Like many of you, I have been keeping a close eye on the development of Aurelia&#x27;s validation plugin(s) for some time now. This truly was the last missing piece of the puzzle for me in terms of being able to fully drop external JavaScript dependencies, and a notable gap in Aurelia&#x27;s stable offering during the 1.0 release.</p>

          <p>Currently our blog is located at blog.durandal.io. That&#x27;s a bit odd considering all the content here is directly related to Aurelia. So, we&#x27;ll be moving the blog to blog.aurelia.io this coming week. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. Thanks!</p>
