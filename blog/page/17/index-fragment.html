          <p>The open web and web standards have always been an important part of Aurelia. We don&#x27;t want to abstract the web away from you, but rather enable you to use cutting edge web technology in a practical way while building applications. Our commitment to these principles brings the Aurelia community the first implementation of Shadow DOM v1 Slots. It&#x27;s an awesome piece of technology and we look forward to seeing how you leverage it to build amazing apps.</p>

          <p>&quot;Aurelia For Real World Web Applications&quot; is for anyone wanting to dip their feet or dive head first into the Aurelia JavaScript framework. The book assumes no previous knowledge of Aurelia or any other JavaScript framework, and aims to be a comprehensive be all and end all resource on Aurelia. The book helps guide you through setting up a development environment, offers advice on structuring your applications and how to build components. At the end of the book you will take all of the knowledge you have learned in previous chapters and build actual working web applications (with full source code provided).</p>

          <p>In our last full team meeting, we made a goal to have weekly releases, targeting Tuesday. Each release should, naturally, be accompanied by release notes tracking everything contained in the day&#x27;s releases along with any notes on emergency patch releases done out-of-band in the previous week.</p>
