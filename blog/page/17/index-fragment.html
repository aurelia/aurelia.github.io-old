          <p>Lots of exciting things are happening with Aurelia these days. We&#x27;ve got a new set of updates that bring along many bug fixes as well as a few new features. We&#x27;ve also managed to decrease the minimal size of the library by a significant amount.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia and Kendo UI</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">January 28, 2016</span>
          <p>Today, I&#x27;m really excited to introduce to you three innovative community members: Nikolaj Ivancic, Charles Pockert and Jeroen Vinke. They&#x27;ve been working together to create native Aurelia components for the Kendo UI suite, as well as a number of other tools for &quot;bridging&quot; the gap between existing component libraries and Aurelia. I asked them to put together a blog post that we could share with you here, announcing and explaining their work. Read on to learn more about the Aurelia UI Toolkits project.</p>
