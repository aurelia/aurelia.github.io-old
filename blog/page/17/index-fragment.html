          <p>You&#x27;ve been diligent in keeping up with Aurelia updates, and so today you update your libraries. Or perhaps you just started using Aurelia today and are pulling down the latest release...but something&#x27;s not right. Some d.ts files are missing. Things aren&#x27;t compiling correctly and your app is broken. What do you do now!?</p>

          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">June 2, 2016</span>
          <p>Next week at NDC Oslo, Rob Eisenberg will be presenting a two-day workshop titled &quot;Modern Web Applications with Aurelia&quot;. Over the course of two days, you&#x27;ll cover every major topic in Aurelia development through a combination of both lecture-style learning and interactive, collaborative application building. When you complete these two days, you won&#x27;t only know how to build applications with Aurelia, but you&#x27;ll also have a slick application you helped to build as part of the process.</p>

          <p>Hopefully you saw our big announcement yesterday [http://blog.durandal.io/2016/05/23/aurelia-shadow-dom-v1-slots-prerelease/] about support for Shadow DOM v1 Slots in Aurelia. It&#x27;s an exciting milestone for us on our road towards Release Candidate and as part of our commitment to web standards. Today, we have a number of patch releases to various Aurelia libraries. The list is relatively small. You can read the details below.</p>

          <p>The open web and web standards have always been an important part of Aurelia. We don&#x27;t want to abstract the web away from you, but rather enable you to use cutting edge web technology in a practical way while building applications. Our commitment to these principles brings the Aurelia community the first implementation of Shadow DOM v1 Slots. It&#x27;s an awesome piece of technology and we look forward to seeing how you leverage it to build amazing apps.</p>
