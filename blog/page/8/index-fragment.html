          <h3>json-schema validation</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">September 9, 2016</span>
          <p>Like many of you, I have been keeping a close eye on the development of Aurelia&#x27;s validation plugin(s) for some time now. This truly was the last missing piece of the puzzle for me in terms of being able to fully drop external JavaScript dependencies, and a notable gap in Aurelia&#x27;s stable offering during the 1.0 release.</p>
