          <h3>Introducing Aurelia in Action</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">July 13, 2017</span>
          <p>Aurelia in Action [https://www.manning.com/books/aurelia-in-action] is a book targeted at teaching you what you need to build compelling, real-world applications in Aurelia from the ground up. The book centres around a fictional virtual bookshelf application (similar to Goodreads.com [https://www.goodreads.com/]) called my-books. We start off by creating a bare-bones application via the Aurelia CLI, then progressively layer on various features that users would want in a virtual bookshelf. By the end of the book we&#x27;ve built out a fully fledged SPA, giving you the chance to familiarise yourself with the many tools available in Aurelia&#x27;s tool-belt along the way.

          <p>This year, Aurelia&#x27;s theme has been one of building out our ecosystem by enhancing plugins, tools, learning and community opportunity. Our releases today reflect that focus by showcasing improvements to several plugins (UX, Dialog and i18n) and launching a big update to our CLI.</p>
