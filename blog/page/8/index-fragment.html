          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">June 12, 2017</span>
          <p>This year, Aurelia&#x27;s theme has been one of building out our ecosystem by enhancing plugins, tools, learning and community opportunity. Our releases today reflect that focus by showcasing improvements to several plugins (UX, Dialog and i18n) and launching a big update to our CLI.</p>
