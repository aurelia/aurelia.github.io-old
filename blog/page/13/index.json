Keith has been a software engineer and architect for almost 20 years. After a lot of work with ASP back in the early 2000s, he veered off into the design and development of service oriented architectures. However, a couple years ago he was reintroduced to UI development through AngularJS, and has recently spent a lot of time getting to know some of the latest JavaScript frameworks - Angular 2, React, and Aurelia. Of particular note, Keith has been doing some great work to improve the Aurelia experience for ASP.NET developers. I'll let him tell you about it in his own words...","updatedAt":"2016-11-17T16:17:07.000Z","publishedAt":"2016-11-17T16:11:37.000Z","links":{"static":"blog/2016/11/17/aurelia-in-asp-net-javascriptservices","html":"blog/2016/11/17/aurelia-in-asp-net-javascriptservices/index.html","fragment":"blog/2016/11/17/aurelia-in-asp-net-javascriptservices/index-fragment.html","self":"blog/2016/11/17/aurelia-in-asp-net-javascriptservices/index.json"}},{"name":"Release Update - 11/10/2016","slug":"release-update-11-10-2016","author":{"name":"AureliaEffect"},"description":"Aurelia continues to push forward with regular releases that have fixes and improvements to various parts of the platform.

Aurelia provides the core capabilities you need to build apps, such as templating, binding, an application model, routing and dependency injection. We've also created tons of plugins for http, i18n, validation, etc. and partnered with various community groups to build even more. However, there's always been something missing. Today we're introducing Aurelia UX [https://github.com/aurelia/ux], a completely free, open source user experience framework with higher-level capabilities, designed to bring simplicity and elegance to building cross-device, rich experiences.","updatedAt":"2016-11-04T16:31:48.000Z","publishedAt":"2016-11-04T16:31:48.000Z","links":{"static":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux","html":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux/index.html","fragment":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux/index-fragment.html","self":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux/index.json"}},{"name":"Introducing SpoonX Community Plugins","slug":"introducing-spoonx-community-plugins-2","author":{"name":"AureliaEffect"},"description":"Today, I'm happy to introduce to you another Aurelia community group that's built at least a dozen amazing plugins for our community.
