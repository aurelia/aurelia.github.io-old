          <p>It&#x27;s been an amazing journey to get here and it couldn&#x27;t have happened without the feedback of thousands of community members, the contributions from hundreds of developers and the guidance of our core team. It&#x27;s a special day in the history of our project. Today I&#x27;m proud to announce the official Aurelia 1.0 Release!</p>

          <p>For some time, we&#x27;ve been working on a component library for Aurelia: a suite of controls that would enable hybrid mobile development on iOS and Android, as well as desktop and browser-based development by leveraging Material Design. In today&#x27;s update, we&#x27;d like to share with you a bit about our journey, where we&#x27;re at and what the future looks like.</p>

          <p>You&#x27;ve been diligent in keeping up with Aurelia updates, and so today you update your libraries. Or perhaps you just started using Aurelia today and are pulling down the latest release...but something&#x27;s not right. Some d.ts files are missing. Things aren&#x27;t compiling correctly and your app is broken. What do you do now!?</p>
