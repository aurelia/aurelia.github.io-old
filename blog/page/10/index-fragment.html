          <h3>Aurelia in ASP.NET JavaScriptServices</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 17, 2016</span>
          <p>Today I&#x27;d like to introduce you to Aurelia community member Keith Katsma. Keith has been a software engineer and architect for almost 20 years. After a lot of work with ASP back in the early 2000s, he veered off into the design and development of service oriented architectures. However, a couple years ago he was reintroduced to UI development through AngularJS, and has recently spent a lot of time getting to know some of the latest JavaScript frameworks - Angular 2, React, and Aurelia. Of particular note, Keith has been doing some great work to improve the Aurelia experience for ASP.NET developers. I&#x27;ll let him tell you about it in his own words...</p>

          <h3>Introducing Aurelia UX</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 4, 2016</span>
          <p>In 2015 we first announced Aurelia, a modern frontend framework with an emphasis on convention over configuration, web standards and productivity. Aurelia provides the core capabilities you need to build apps, such as templating, binding, an application model, routing and dependency injection. We&#x27;ve also created tons of plugins for http, i18n, validation, etc. and partnered with various community groups to build even more. However, there&#x27;s always been something missing. Today we&#x27;re introducing Aurelia UX [https://github.com/aurelia/ux], a completely free, open source user experience framework with higher-level capabilities, designed to bring simplicity and elegance to building cross-device, rich experiences.</p>

          <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Erik Lieben [https://www.eriklieben.com], and I am a developer from the Netherlands working at Effectory [https://www.effectory.com] and co-organizer of the Aurelia Amsterdam [https://www.meetup.com/Aurelia-Amsterdam-meetup/] meetup. In my spare time, I will be working as a member of the Aurelia Core Team on the official vscode-extension [https://github.com/aurelia/vscode-extension/]. With this extension, we hope to provide you with a pleasant development experience when building Aurelia applications using Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com].</p>
