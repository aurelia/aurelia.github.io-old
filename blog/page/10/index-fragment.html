          <h3>Introducing Aurelia in Action</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">July 13, 2017</span>
          <p>Aurelia in Action [https://www.manning.com/books/aurelia-in-action] is a book targeted at teaching you what you need to build compelling, real-world applications in Aurelia from the ground up. The book centres around a fictional virtual bookshelf application (similar to Goodreads.com [https://www.goodreads.com/]) called my-books. We start off by creating a bare-bones application via the Aurelia CLI, then progressively layer on various features that users would want in a virtual bookshelf. By the end of the book we&#x27;ve built out a fully fledged SPA, giving you the chance to familiarise yourself with the many tools available in Aurelia&#x27;s tool-belt along the way.
