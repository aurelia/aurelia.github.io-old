          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">October 11, 2016</span>
          <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Erik Lieben [https://www.eriklieben.com], and I am a developer from the Netherlands working at Effectory [https://www.effectory.com] and co-organizer of the Aurelia Amsterdam [https://www.meetup.com/Aurelia-Amsterdam-meetup/] meetup. In my spare time, I will be working as a member of the Aurelia Core Team on the official vscode-extension [https://github.com/aurelia/vscode-extension/]. With this extension, we hope to provide you with a pleasant development experience when building Aurelia applications using Visual Studio Code [https://code.visualstudio.com].</p>

          <p>One of Aurelia&#x27;s greatest strengths is the dedication and ingenuity of its community. Today we&#x27;d like to introduce you to a community group that is building all sorts of tools and extensions for Aurelia. Fittingly, they call themselves the Aurelia Tools Team. Read on to hear directly from their team lead, Adriatic, about the exciting new technology they are building for Aurelia developers.</p>
