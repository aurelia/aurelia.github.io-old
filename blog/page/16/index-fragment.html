          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">March 29, 2016</span>
          <p>In the last month we&#x27;ve accomplished a couple of major goals on our way to the official v1 release of Aurelia: updating to Babel 6, removing required external polyfills and dual compatibility with JSPM 16 and 17. This week, we&#x27;ve got a few fixes and some extra goodies.</p>

          <p>This week we launched updates of Aurelia libraries built with Babel 6. We had one library that we weren&#x27;t able to update at that time: aurelia-i18n.</p>

          <p>Finally...we are almost ready to release an update to Aurelia which moves us onto Babel 6.x. At the same time, we&#x27;ve got fixes and have done testing to enable preliminary support for JSPM 0.17.x soon too.</p>
