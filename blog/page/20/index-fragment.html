          <p>Next week, Rob Eisenberg will be be presenting at DevSum 2015 [http://www.devsum.se/] in Stockholm. He&#x27;ll be giving two presentations [http://www.devsum.se/speaker/rob-eisenberg/] on Aurelia. They function as a sort of &quot;part one&quot; and &quot;part two&quot; to help developers get up and going with the framework. On Wednesday, Tibi Covaci and Rob will be doing an all-day workshop [http://www.devsum.se/rob-eisenberg-och-tibi-covaci-the-aurelia-workshop/] on Aurelia as well. If you are in or around Stockholm, we hope you will come and check it out.</p>

          <h3>Porting an Angular 2.0 App to Aurelia</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">May 20, 2015</span>
          <p>Recently, Joe Eames [https://twitter.com/josepheames] had a nice PluralSight [http://www.pluralsight.com] webinar demonstrating some of the features of Angular 2.0. We thought &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to see the same app built with Aurelia?&quot; It seemed like a good opportunity to show what we feel makes Aurelia so easy-to-use and efficient.</p>
