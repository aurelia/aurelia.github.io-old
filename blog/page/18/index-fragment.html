          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">August 4, 2015</span>
          <p>The spec for the standard JS module loader has recently been changing. The JSPM and SystemJS teams have been working hard to align with the new specs. And as of this release, Aurelia is now aligned with the new JSPM and SystemJS Beta.</p>

          <p>This week we&#x27;re excited to feature another fantastic member of the Aurelia community: Tomasz Frydrychewicz [https://github.com/tfrydrychewicz]. Thomas is a full stack developer in love with JavaScript and is always looking for an opportunity to spread that enthusiasm around. He&#x27;s a big fan of reactive, event driven architectures and asynchronous programing. During the last five years he introduced Angular to different societies but is recently infatuated with Aurelia and its approach to modern JavaScript frameworks. Thomas is the author of the aurelia-flux [https://github.com/tfrydrychewicz/aurelia-flux] plugin, which you can hear about in his own words below.</p>

          <h3>Bundling an Aurelia Application</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">June 23, 2015</span>
          <p>Aurelia is a next generation framework that promotes good design patterns and practices. The next version of HTTP, HTTP/2 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2], may very well obsolete the necessity of creating bundles in the future, but we are not there just yet. Nobody likes to see a production application making 256 requests when loading. That&#x27;s why Aurelia takes bundling very seriously. Read on to find out how to get your app bundled up for deploy using our new CLI.</p>
