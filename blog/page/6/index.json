Most other frameworks have several major breaking change releases every year. Aurelia's stability is something we know our community appreciates, and it's something we're very proud of. That said, it has been almost four years and the time has finally come to think about Aurelia's next major version.","updatedAt":"2021-02-06T02:27:04.965Z","publishedAt":"2018-08-06T04:18:48.924Z","links":{"static":"blog\\2018\\8\\6\\aurelia-vnext","html":"blog\\2018\\8\\6\\aurelia-vnext\\index.html","fragment":"blog\\2018\\8\\6\\aurelia-vnext\\index-fragment.html","self":"blog\\2018\\8\\6\\aurelia-vnext\\index.json"}}]}
