          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">April 27, 2017</span>
          <p>Our most recent set of Aurelia releases includes the Aurelia Dialog Release Candidate. We have a post dedicated to the details of that release, which you can read here [http://blog.aurelia.io/2017/04/27/aurelia-dialog-release-candidate/]. You&#x27;ll also see that Aurelia UX is moving ahead steadily, with new components and capabilities being added every one to two weeks.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Release Notes - Early April 2017</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">April 12, 2017</span>
          <p>As always, we continue to make improvements to Aurelia&#x27;s core as well as its most popular plugins. This set of releases includes not only bug fixes, but substantial improvements to the Aurelia Webpack Plugin, Aurelia UX, Aurelia CLI and our UI Virtualization Library.</p>

          <p>One of the exciting things we get to do on the Aurelia blog is share various customer stories and case studies. Sometimes, it&#x27;s for large, well-known companies like The Nordic Cinema Group [http://blog.aurelia.io/2017/01/18/case-study-nordic-cinema-group/] but at other times we get to tell the equally-exciting story of a developer who launched their first tech startup.</p>
