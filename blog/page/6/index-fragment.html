          <h3>Aurelia Release Notes - Late January 2019</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">Rob Eisenberg</span> on <span class="date">January 23, 2019</span>
          <p>2019 is off to a great start with another set of releases that address bugs and add new features to Aurelia. We&#x27;re also continuing to enable more plugins for script-file deploy along the way. Of particular note is our recent improvements to the aurelia-ui-virtualization plugin for virtual and infinite scrolling. What? You didn&#x27;t know there was an official plugin for that? Check out this demo to see what it can do [https://aurelia-ui-virtualization.now.sh/].</p>
