          <h3>Aurelia Interface Update</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">June 24, 2016</span>
          <p>For some time, we&#x27;ve been working on a component library for Aurelia: a suite of controls that would enable hybrid mobile development on iOS and Android, as well as desktop and browser-based development by leveraging Material Design. In today&#x27;s update, we&#x27;d like to share with you a bit about our journey, where we&#x27;re at and what the future looks like.</p>

          <p>You&#x27;ve been diligent in keeping up with Aurelia updates, and so today you update your libraries. Or perhaps you just started using Aurelia today and are pulling down the latest release...but something&#x27;s not right. Some d.ts files are missing. Things aren&#x27;t compiling correctly and your app is broken. What do you do now!?</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Workshop at NDC Oslo</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">June 2, 2016</span>
          <p>Next week at NDC Oslo, Rob Eisenberg will be presenting a two-day workshop titled &quot;Modern Web Applications with Aurelia&quot;. Over the course of two days, you&#x27;ll cover every major topic in Aurelia development through a combination of both lecture-style learning and interactive, collaborative application building. When you complete these two days, you won&#x27;t only know how to build applications with Aurelia, but you&#x27;ll also have a slick application you helped to build as part of the process.</p>
