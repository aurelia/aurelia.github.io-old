          <p>This week we launched updates of Aurelia libraries built with Babel 6. We had one library that we weren&#x27;t able to update at that time: aurelia-i18n.</p>

          <p>Lots of exciting things are happening with Aurelia these days. We&#x27;ve got a new set of updates that bring along many bug fixes as well as a few new features. We&#x27;ve also managed to decrease the minimal size of the library by a significant amount.</p>
