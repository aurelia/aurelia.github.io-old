In this set of releases, we've got a minor breaking change to our dialog plugin. We've also converted our testing library to TypeScript. While we've made no changes to the API or behavior, we've bumped the major version since the improved, more-accurate typings may affect some TypeScript users. Finally, we've launched another major set of enhancements to the CLI and made our initial launch of the HTTP Mocking library.
