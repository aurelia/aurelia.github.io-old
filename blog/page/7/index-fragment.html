          <h3>Aurelia Release Notes - June 2018</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">The Aurelia Core Team</span> on <span class="date">June 25, 2018</span>
          <p>June is a significant month for Aurelia. Our latest set of releases adds some great new features for our templating engine, allowing more seamless Webpack builds and an even more unobtrusive programming model. We&#x27;ve also made huge improvements to our binding engine, including adding new keywords and beefing up performance. Finally, the Aurelia Store plugin was released! Read on to get the details from the Aurelia Core Team.</p>

          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">Rob Eisenberg</span> on <span class="date">May 11, 2018</span>
          <p>We&#x27;re excited to be working on a number of great new improvements to Aurelia&#x27;s templating and binding engines. Just this week we&#x27;ve released the first set of improvements to the binding engine, which merge the Lexer and the Parser. By doing this we were able to increase the performance of binding parsing by 10x in some cases!</p>
