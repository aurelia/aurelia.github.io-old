          <h3>Hope Through Hollis</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">February 27, 2017</span>
          <p>As a community of developers, we often get to share the joy of each other&#x27;s successes. However, sometimes, people close to us experience great pain or loss as well. In those times, it&#x27;s all the more important to help support and lift each other up. Below, I&#x27;ve invited Aurelia Core Team member, Shannon Horn, and his family to tell us about their Hollis, a vibrant young man, whose time was too short with us.</p>
