The book centres around a fictional virtual bookshelf application (similar to Goodreads.com [https://www.goodreads.com/]) called my-books. We start off by creating a bare-bones application via the Aurelia CLI, then progressively layer on various features that users would want in a virtual bookshelf. By the end of the book we've built out a fully fledged SPA, giving you the chance to familiarise yourself with the many tools available in Aurelia's tool-belt along the way.
