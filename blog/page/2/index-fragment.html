          <p>Here at Aurelia HQ, we have been busy beavers. Work on Aurelia 2 continues full steam ahead. We are doing more frequent development releases. You might have noticed we are engaging the community a little bit better after the noticeable silence.</p>

          <p>Hi everyone, we hope you have been staying healthy and safe in these uncertain times we still find ourselves in. Unfortunately, things slowed down a bit in Aurelia land over the last few months due to unforeseen circumstances. We are happy to report that we&#x27;ve now been able to adapt to these changes, and you&#x27;re going to see more releases and development work as we focus on completing Aurelia 2. We also realize that a lot of the work that has been done can easily be missed if you&#x27;re not watching the GitHub [https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia], so make sure you keep an eye on that one too.</p>
