          <h3>Aurelia Release Notes - Early February 2019</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">Rob Eisenberg</span> on <span class="date">February 4, 2019</span>
          <p>We&#x27;ve had a few new releases over the last few weeks. Among them are continued updates to the Aurelia CLI. In fact, we found an issue in the CLI that affected new Webpack projects, so be sure to update your CLI before starting anything new. More details concerning the various releases can be found below.</p>

          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">Rob Eisenberg</span> on <span class="date">January 22, 2019</span>
          <p>2019 is off to a great start with another set of releases that address bugs and add new features to Aurelia. We&#x27;re also continuing to enable more plugins for script-file deploy along the way. Of particular note is our recent improvements to the aurelia-ui-virtualization plugin for virtual and infinite scrolling. What? You didn&#x27;t know there was an official plugin for that? Check out this demo to see what it can do [https://aurelia-ui-virtualization.now.sh/].</p>
