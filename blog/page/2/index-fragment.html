          <h3>Aurelia vNext</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">Rob Eisenberg</span> on <span class="date">August 5, 2018</span>
          <p>The codebase of today&#x27;s Aurelia is approaching 4 years old. Much has changed in the industry since 2014, with advances in JavaScript, TypeScript, module loading, packaging, browsers, tooling, and much more. We&#x27;ve worked hard over the years to maintain full backwards compatibility and minimal-to-no breaking changes. We&#x27;re one of the only frameworks that has managed to achieve this. Most other frameworks have several major breaking change releases every year. Aurelia&#x27;s stability is something we know our community appreciates, and it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re very proud of. That said, it has been almost four years and the time has finally come to think about Aurelia&#x27;s next major version.</p>
