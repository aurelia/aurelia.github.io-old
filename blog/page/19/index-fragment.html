          <p>In March we had the opportunity to do our second workshop in Europe. The two-day workshop in London was a fantastic success, having sold out multiple times over. Since then we&#x27;ve refined our training materials and we&#x27;re bringing more workshops to Europe.</p>

          <p>The Aurelia team is hard at work preparing for our Release Candidate...but that&#x27;s not all we&#x27;re working on. We&#x27;re always looking for ways to improve tooling, debugging and collaboration with community members and other vendors along the way.</p>
