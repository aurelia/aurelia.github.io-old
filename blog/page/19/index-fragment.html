          <h3>Porting an Angular 2.0 App to Aurelia</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">May 20, 2015</span>
          <p>Recently, Joe Eames [https://twitter.com/josepheames] had a nice PluralSight [http://www.pluralsight.com] webinar demonstrating some of the features of Angular 2.0. We thought &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to see the same app built with Aurelia?&quot; It seemed like a good opportunity to show what we feel makes Aurelia so easy-to-use and efficient.</p>

          <p>Interested in getting a walkthrough of building your first Aurelia app? I&#x27;ve got good news for you. Today, in Montreal, I&#x27;ll be presenting an introductory talk at the Radio Canada studios at 7PM EDT. Don&#x27;t live in Montreal? No problem. Radio-Canada Lab [http://lab.radio-canada.ca/] has generously offered to not only produce the show but live stream it on YouTube. You will be able to watch it live from anywhere in the world [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;6Pd53umA5wc].</p>
