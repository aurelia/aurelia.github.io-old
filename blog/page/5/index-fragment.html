          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">April 18, 2017</span>
          <p>Today we&#x27;re excited to launch our official weekly Aurelia newsletter. Each week we&#x27;ll be featuring Aurelia announcements, events, articles, community surveys and important web industry news. If you haven&#x27;t already signed up, you can get on the list here [http://eepurl.com/ces50j]. We&#x27;re thrilled to have Aurelia Core Team member Andreas WÃ¤nqvist [https://github.com/mobilemancer] putting together this great content on a regular basis and we look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>

          <h3>Aurelia Release Notes - Early April 2017</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">April 12, 2017</span>
          <p>As always, we continue to make improvements to Aurelia&#x27;s core as well as its most popular plugins. This set of releases includes not only bug fixes, but substantial improvements to the Aurelia Webpack Plugin, Aurelia UX, Aurelia CLI and our UI Virtualization Library.</p>

          <h3>Case Study: netroStation</h3>

          <p>One of the exciting things we get to do on the Aurelia blog is share various customer stories and case studies. Sometimes, it&#x27;s for large, well-known companies like The Nordic Cinema Group [http://blog.aurelia.io/2017/01/18/case-study-nordic-cinema-group/] but at other times we get to tell the equally-exciting story of a developer who launched their first tech startup.</p>

          <h3>Hope Through Hollis</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">February 27, 2017</span>
          <p>As a community of developers, we often get to share the joy of each other&#x27;s successes. However, sometimes, people close to us experience great pain or loss as well. In those times, it&#x27;s all the more important to help support and lift each other up. Below, I&#x27;ve invited Aurelia Core Team member, Shannon Horn, and his family to tell us about their Hollis, a vibrant young man, whose time was too short with us.</p>
