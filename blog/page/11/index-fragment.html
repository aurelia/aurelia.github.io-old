          <h3>Aurelia Authentication Using Firebase</h3>
          <p class="group-item-count">Posted by <span class="author">AureliaEffect</span> on <span class="date">November 23, 2016</span>
          <p>As a recovering full-stack developer who went the specialised front-end route a few years ago, the one aspect I have always hated about building any feature-rich web application is authentication. Thankfully a lot of convenient options have popped up over the last couple of years like Auth0 [https://auth0.com/].</p>

          <p>Today I&#x27;d like to introduce you to Aurelia community member Keith Katsma. Keith has been a software engineer and architect for almost 20 years. After a lot of work with ASP back in the early 2000s, he veered off into the design and development of service oriented architectures. However, a couple years ago he was reintroduced to UI development through AngularJS, and has recently spent a lot of time getting to know some of the latest JavaScript frameworks - Angular 2, React, and Aurelia. Of particular note, Keith has been doing some great work to improve the Aurelia experience for ASP.NET developers. I&#x27;ll let him tell you about it in his own words...</p>
