Aurelia provides the core capabilities you need to build apps, such as templating, binding, an application model, routing and dependency injection. We've also created tons of plugins for http, i18n, validation, etc. and partnered with various community groups to build even more. However, there's always been something missing. Today we're introducing Aurelia UX [https://github.com/aurelia/ux], a completely free, open source user experience framework with higher-level capabilities, designed to bring simplicity and elegance to building cross-device, rich experiences.","updatedAt":"2016-11-04T16:31:48.000Z","publishedAt":"2016-11-04T16:31:48.000Z","links":{"static":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux","html":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux/index.html","fragment":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux/index-fragment.html","self":"blog/2016/11/04/introducing-aurelia-ux/index.json"}},{"name":"Introducing SpoonX Community Plugins","slug":"introducing-spoonx-community-plugins-2","author":{"name":"AureliaEffect"},"description":"Today, I'm happy to introduce to you another Aurelia community group that's built at least a dozen amazing plugins for our community.
