This was originally implemented to avoid adding the runtime to the secondary \"vendor\" entry. Using \"vendor\" entry points is no longer recommended for Webpack 4 and up.\r\n\r\n## Minor Releases\r\n\r\nMinor updates include new features, updates to bugs, and performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-ui-virtualization 1.0.0-beta.7](https://github.com/aurelia/ui-virtualization/compare/1.0.0-beta.6...1.0.0-beta.7)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* **repeat:** ensure revert mutation handling ([869bc34](https://github.com/aurelia/ui-virtualization/commit/869bc34))\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-templating-resources 1.10.0](https://github.com/aurelia/templating-resources/compare/1.9.1...1.10.0)\r\n\r\n* Conversion to TypeScript.\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-router 1.7.0](https://github.com/aurelia/router/compare/1.6.3...1.7.0)\r\n\r\n* Conversion to TypeScript.\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-templating-router 1.4.0](https://github.com/aurelia/router/compare/1.3.3...1.4.0)\r\n\r\n* Conversion to TypeScript.\r\n\r\n## Patch Releases\r\n\r\nPatch updates include only fixes to bugs and performance improvements.\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-store 1.3.4](https://github.com/aurelia/store/compare/1.3.3...1.3.4)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* **dist:** add umd-es2015, adjust unpkg field, umd build to es5 ([741026c](https://github.com/aurelia/store/commit/741026c))\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-binding 2.3.1](https://github.com/aurelia/binding/compare/2.2.0...2.3.1)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* **all:** change es2015 back to native-modules ([13dd661](https://github.com/aurelia/binding/commit/13dd661))\r\n* **build:** don't build declaration ([d359e83](https://github.com/aurelia/binding/commit/d359e83))\r\n* **connectable-binding:** remove the silent limit of 100 observers per expression ([56ba36d](https://github.com/aurelia/binding/commit/56ba36d)), closes [#742](https://github.com/aurelia/binding/issues/742)\r\n\r\n### [aurelia-history-browser 1.3.2](https://github.com/aurelia/history-browser/compare/1.3.1...1.3.2)\r\n\r\n#### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* **browser-history:** decode fragment, add tests ([957532d](https://github.com/aurelia/history-browser/commit/957532d))"}
