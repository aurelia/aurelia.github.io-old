We're hopeful that contributions will continue to grow during that time, and that we can continue to support Fred in the amazing work he's doing for well beyond this initial period.\n\nWe'd like to take this opportunity to give a special thanks to [Hogia](https://www.hogia.se/), our Gold Sponsor. Without Hogia and the many other financial contributors, this wouldn't be possible.\n\nIf you or your company is looking for an opportunity to contribute to open source, [we would love for you to consider contributing to Aurelia](https://opencollective.com/aurelia). Help us continue to support Fred and to fund additional team members in full-time work. Together we can build the best front-end ecosystem and continue to help real companies deliver best-in-class solutions to their customers.\n\nThank you!"}
