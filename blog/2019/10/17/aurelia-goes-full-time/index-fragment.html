      <p>Last week we hit a major milestone in Aurelia's history: one of our core team members, Fred Kleuver, was funded to work full-time on Aurelia.</p>
<p>Thanks to 
<a href="https://github.com/aurelia/framework/blob/master/BACKERS.md" target="_blank">the generous financial contributions of many companies</a>
, we've raised enough money and have enough ongoing contributions to fund 
<a href="https://github.com/fkleuver" target="_blank">Fred Kleuver</a>
 to work full-time on Aurelia for at least the next 6 months. We're hopeful that contributions will continue to grow during that time, and that we can continue to support Fred in the amazing work he's doing for well beyond this initial period.</p>
<p>We'd like to take this opportunity to give a special thanks to 
<a href="https://www.hogia.se/" target="_blank">Hogia</a>
, our Gold Sponsor. Without Hogia and the many other financial contributors, this wouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>If you or your company is looking for an opportunity to contribute to open source, 
<a href="https://opencollective.com/aurelia" target="_blank">we would love for you to consider contributing to Aurelia</a>
. Help us continue to support Fred and to fund additional team members in full-time work. Together we can build the best front-end ecosystem and continue to help real companies deliver best-in-class solutions to their customers.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
