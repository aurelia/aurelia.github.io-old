It's been a long and winding road, but thanks to the community and core team, we're very happy with where we've landed.\n\nIf you haven't used the Aurelia CLI before, it's the best way to get up and running with a new Aurelia project. To install the CLI, from your command prompt, simply run `npm install aurelia-cli -g`. With the CLI installed, you can create a new project by running `au new`. The CLI will then ask you a few questions, create your project, and install its dependencies. Once completed, you can execute `au run` to immediately start your new app.\n\nThanks to the contributions of our community, the CLI supports all the most popular bundlers, testing tools, CSS frameworks, and more. As a result, you don't have to deal with the hassle of figuring out how to get your preferred set of tools working together; the CLI already has that worked out. Here's what we support out of the box:\n\n* **Bundlers and Loaders** - Webpack (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 optimizations), Require.js, System.js\n* **Transpilers** - Babel, TypeScript\n* **CSS Pre/Post Processors** - Less, Sass, Stylus, PostCSS\n* **Unit Testing** - Karma+Jasmine, Jest\n* **Integration Testing** - Protractor, Cypress\n* **Package Managers** - NPM, Yarn\n* **And more...** - .NET project support, HTML minification, VS Code setup, etc.\n\nIf all these options seem overwhelming, never fear! When you run the CLI, you can also select a default Babel or TypeScript configuration. Also, if you've got a specific combination that you always use, the CLI now supports an \"unattended\" mode, which allows you to specify all your choices on the command prompt, without having to go through the wizard. The CLI will even teach you how to do this after you create your first project :)\n\nIn addition to project creation, the CLI allows you to run your app in \"watch\" mode, refreshing the browser as you make changes, and build for production, automatically handling environment-specific configuration and code injection. To further enhance the development experience, the CLI also ships with a default set of generators to assist you in quickly creating custom elements, custom attributes, and more. Naturally, you can create your own generators, as well as extend the CLI with your own commands.\n\nWe hope you enjoy using the Aurelia CLI as much as we did building it. As always, we're not stopping here. We'll be bringing the CLI tech forward, continuing to enhance it for Aurelia vNext as well.\n\n### Other Releases\n\nWe've had a number of other releases in addition to the Aurelia CLI. All the nitty gritty details can be found below.
