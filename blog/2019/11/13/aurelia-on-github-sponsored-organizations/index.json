It's a platform and ecosystem, built on the open web, enabling the creation of ambitious user interfaces. Sustaining Aurelia wouldn't be possible at all without [the support of our sponsors](https://github.com/aurelia/framework/blob/master/BACKERS.md). Now, thanks to GitHub, we have a new way for you to contribute. Please [visit our new Aurelia sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/aurelia) on GitHub to learn more about how you can help.\n\nIf you're wondering what kinds of things your sponsorship has enabled in recent months, here are a few related posts:\n\n* [Full-time Development on Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/blog/2019/10/17/aurelia-goes-full-time/)\n* [Aurelia 2](https://aurelia.io/blog/2019/10/31/aurelia-vnext-2019-fall-update/)\n* Continued fixes and enhancements to Aurelia 1, [month](https://aurelia.io/blog/2019/09/10/aurelia-release-notes-september-2019/) over [month](https://aurelia.io/blog/2019/06/02/aurelia-release-notes-june-2019/) over [month](https://aurelia.io/blog/2019/05/05/aurelia-release-notes-may-2019/) over [month](https://aurelia.io/blog/2019/04/02/aurelia-release-notes-april-2019)..."}
