      <link>http://aurelia.io/blog/2018/08/05/aurelia-vnext</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The codebase of today's Aurelia is approaching 4 years old. Much has changed in the industry since 2014, with advances in JavaScript, TypeScript, module loading, packaging, browsers, tooling, and much more. We've worked hard over the years to maintain full backwards compatibility and minimal-to-no breaking changes. We're one of the only frameworks that has managed to achieve this. Most other frameworks have several major breaking change releases every year. Aurelia's stability is something we know our community appreciates, and it's something we're very proud of. That said, it has been almost four years and the time has finally come to think about Aurelia's next major version.]]></description>
