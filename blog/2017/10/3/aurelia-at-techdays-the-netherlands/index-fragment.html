<h3>Introduction to building modern web applications using Aurelia and Typescript</h3>
<p><strong>Presented by Erik Lieben</strong></p>
<p><em>Techdays The Netherlands, 12 October 15:00 - 15:45</em></p>
<p>Aurelia is a next generation JavaScript client framework for building mobile, desktop and web.
It’s the most standards-compliant, highly performing and simplest technology of its kind today.
In this session, we will look at how to get started with building your first Aurelia application
while using TypeScript and Visual Studio Code.</p>

<h3>Modular Single Page Applications with ASP.NET Core, webpack and Aurelia</h3>
<p><strong>Presented by Jonathan Mezach</strong></p>
<p><em>Techdays The Netherlands, 12 October 16:30 - 17:15</em></p>
<p>Microservices are all the rage these days, and with good reason. They allow us to independently
develop, deploy and evolve services, possibly across different teams. But what if we could apply
the same principle to our frontend as well? In this talk I would like to show how we can achieve
this using ASP.NET Core with JavaScript Services, webpack and Aurelia based on a real-world
scenario where we’ve build such a modular application while still feeling like a single
application for our users.</p>
