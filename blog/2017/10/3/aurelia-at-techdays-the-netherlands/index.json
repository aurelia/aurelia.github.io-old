They allow us to independently \ndevelop, deploy and evolve services, possibly across different teams. But what if we could apply \nthe same principle to our frontend as well? In this talk I would like to show how we can achieve \nthis using ASP.NET Core with JavaScript Services, webpack and Aurelia based on a real-world \nscenario where we’ve build such a modular application while still feeling like a single \napplication for our users.\n \nhttps://www.techdays.nl/Sessies/#51d09839-4b29-4226-9482-2a3b8c88bd2c"}
