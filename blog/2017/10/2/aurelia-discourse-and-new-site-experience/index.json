At the same time, we've completely overhauled [our site](http://aurelia.io/) and documentation technology, opening the way for better docs and learning to come.\n\nI want to give a huge thanks to [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) for supporting Aurelia with their technology. We're very excited to finally launch a more engaging and persistent way for our community to share with one another. We've seeded the forum with a few fun posts but we really need all of you to jump in and make it a great place. We're looking forward to seeing how our community prospers during this next stage of its life.\n\n![The Aurelia Discourse](/content/images/2017/10/Discourse-Screenshot-1.png)\n\nCoinciding with our Discourse launch, we've made [a major refresh to our site](http://aurelia.io/). The new site is built entirely as a combination of static rendering and Aurelia progressive enhancement.\n\n![The New Aurelia Site](/content/images/2017/10/Site-Screenshot-1.png)\n\nOur re-write has enabled us to greatly improve both SEO and performance. Additionally, we've built this new implementation from the ground up to allow us to grow our documentation and learning offerings more rapidly in the future.\n\nWe've got lots more planned for the new site, but we didn't want to wait any longer to make it and the forum available to our community. We hope you enjoy what we've put together. Stay tuned for more announcements over the coming months."}
