We've got an incredible set of Aurelia releases for you! Today we're pleased to announce the 1.0 release of Aurelia Validation, the Release Candidate of our new Webpack plugin and major updates to the Aurelia CLI.\n\n## Aurelia Validation\n\nWe've been working on our new validation library for quite some time. Thanks to the hard work of Core Team Member Jeremy Danyow, along with countless community members, we're excited to announce the 1.0 release. We've been making tons of incremental improvements as part of the alpha and beta series releases. The 1.0 releases continues in that fashion and also adds the final bit of polish. There's one major new feature as part of the final release: the ability to use Aurelia Validation as a server-side validation library! The full details are in the changelog below. If you've been looking for a great validation library to use with Aurelia or for a validation library to use with any server-side framework, look no further :)\n\n## Aurelia Webpack Plugin\n\nWebpack has had some huge changes over the last year. While Webpack has been steadily improving its offering, Core Team Members Joel Dumas and Bazyli Brzóska have been working tirelessly to build a modernized Webpack setup for Aurelia as well. Together with them, I'd like to thank the many community members who have been providing feedback and early testing already. Today, we're announcing our Webpack Plugin 2.0 Release Candidate. This is a brand new implementation of the plugin, so those who wish to adopt it will need to update their configuration. There are plenty of advantages to the new setup: a much simpler configuration model, it's built for the latest Webpack 2 release, has deeper integration with Webpack itself, etc. This also sets the stage for Hot Module Reload, which is coming soon as well.\n\nWe're still working on official documentation for the new plugin and are in-progres with updating skeleton projects. If you'd like to give the RC plugin a spin, you can find the information you need to get setup in [Joel's Aurelia Webpack Plugin Wiki](https://github.com/jods4/aurelia-webpack-build/wiki). We'll have further announcements when we launch the official documentation and have the skeletons ready.\n\n## Aurelia CLI\n\nWe've got a huge update to the Aurelia CLI today. Here's a brief bit about this release from Aurelia Core Team Member Jeroen Vinke:\n\nIf you are using the Aurelia CLI, you have most likely configured dependencies in the aurelia.json file before. Today we are introducing a new feature of the CLI that can configure dependencies for you. This feature is called the “importer” and can be used in two ways. `au import jquery` will configure the jQuery package in aurelia.json, provided that jQuery has already been installed (by NPM or yarn for example). The second option is `au install jquery`. This command will both install and configure the jQuery package. By default the CLI installs the package using NPM but Yarn can be selected as well. This can be done by setting a `packageManager` property in the aurelia.json file to “yarn”.\n\nThere are many packages available (some adhering to standards and some not), so it can happen that packages are imported incorrectly. When this happens, please let us know so we can work on making the CLI smarter. We would like to thank @martonsagi for his work on `aurelia-cli-pacman` which has been the proof of concept of the importer feature, and @adriatic as well as @Thanood for helping to test the importer with all kinds of packages.\n\n# Release Notes\n\nThere are many more new features, bug fixes and performance enhancements in today's library releases. As always, you can get all the details of the additional minor and patch releases below. If you have any problems updating any of these libraries, you may need to clear your NPM cache and re-install. In some cases, we have noticed that NPM does not correctly pick up all updated dependencies.\n\n## Major Releases\n\nMajor updates may include breaking changes, new features, fixes to bugs and performance improvements.\n\n### [aurelia-validation 1.0.0](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/compare/1.0.0-beta.1.0.1...v1.0.0)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* **build:** add __esModule flag ([0f20d7c](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/0f20d7c)), closes [#417](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/issues/417)\n* **package:** delete unnecessary [@types](https://github.com/types) packages ([f9ec842](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/f9ec842))\n* **package:** update to typescript 2.2 ([65759b4](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/65759b4)), closes [#417](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/issues/417)\n* **ValidationParser:** improve function regex ([5e32142](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/5e32142))\n\n#### Features\n\n* **validation-errors:** enable explicit controller binding ([4fbf24e](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/4fbf24e))\n* **validation-messages:** displayName function ([233fbbc](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/233fbbc))\n* **Validator:** server-side validation ([1b701ab](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/commit/1b701ab)), closes [#398](https://github.com/aurelia/validation/issues/398)\n\n### aurelia-cli 0.25.0\n\n#### Features\n\n* New `au import` command\n* New `au install` command\n* Huge performance improvements to building/bundling.\n* Many minor enhancements.\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\nTons of bugs fixed all over the place.

You will need to update the `prepend` section of your `vendor-bundle.js` configuration to start with the following two files:\n\n\n<code-listing>\n  <source-code lang=\"JavaScript\">\n    \"prepend\": [\n      \"node_modules/bluebird/js/browser/bluebird.core.js\",\n      \"node_modules/aurelia-cli/lib/resources/scripts/configure-bluebird.js\"\n    ]\n  </source-code>\n</code-listing>\n\n###
