Our releases today reflect that focus by showcasing improvements to several plugins (UX, Dialog and i18n) and launching a big update to our CLI.\n\nIf you've had your eyes on our tooling story, you've probably noticed the tremendous amount of work that core team member [Jeroen Vinke](https://github.com/JeroenVinke) has been putting into the Aurelia CLI. We've also had some fantastic community contributions to the CLI by [Simon Fox](https://github.com/simonfox) and [JÃ¼rgen Wenzel](https://github.com/jwx).\n\nToday's release showcases some of this work by providing a new CLI ability to support multiple module loaders and bundlers. Previously, the CLI only supported bundling for the [RequireJS](http://www.requirejs.org) module loader. Today, we're happy to announce that the Aurelia CLI now supports bundling for the [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) module loader as well. We're also excited to share that Aurelia CLI support for Webpack bundling will be available in a near-future release too.\n\nOn top of this core ability to support different loaders and bundlers, we've also done a ton of work to optimize build tasks, better handle concurrent builds and fix plenty of bugs throughout. *Current CLI users who wish to take advantage of the above optimizations should update their CLI version as well as the generated gulp tasks.*\n\nMuch more is going on within the Aurelia ecosystem, especially in our UX library and other core plugins. Please see the release notes below for further details.\n\n## Minor Releases\n\nMinor updates include new features, updates to bugs and performance improvements.\n\n### [aurelia-cli 0.30.0](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/compare/0.29.0...v0.30.0)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* **generators:** create elements/attributes in correct location ([7400e71](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/commit/7400e71))\n* **html-minify:** ignore interpolation expressions ([803c904](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/commit/803c904))\n* **package-analyzer:** infer index.js as main ([f5c0ed1](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/commit/f5c0ed1))\n* **project:** only transpile aurelia_project in project root ([6fd3f7f](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/commit/6fd3f7f))\n\n#### Features\n\n* **all:** systemjs support ([36fa685](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/commit/36fa685)), closes [aurelia/cli#198](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/issues/198)\n* **build:** allow minify options to be supplied ([177b0c7](https://github.com/aurelia/cli/commit/177b0c7))\n\n### [aurelia-ux 0.2.0](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/releases/tag/0.2.0)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* fix delete this.checked issue ([007627d](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/commit/007627d))\n* prepare for pr and fix logging ([2dd51b5](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/commit/2dd51b5))\n\n#### Features\n\n* icon button type ([cf0fea8](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/commit/cf0fea8)), closes [#25](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/issues/25)\n* add material icon set ([4da8ecf](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/commit/4da8ecf))\n* add ux-icon component ([09ff549](https://github.com/aurelia/ux/commit/09ff549))\n\n## Patch Releases\n\nPatch updates include only fixes to bugs and performance improvements.\n\n### [aurelia-i18n 1.6.1](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n/compare/1.6.0...v1.6.1)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* **t-attribute:** warning when using reserved word ([a5b833f](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n/commit/a5b833f)), closes [/github.com/aurelia/i18n/issues/218#issuecomment-304611266](https://github.com//github.com/aurelia/i18n/issues/218/issues/issuecomment-304611266)\n* **uf:** properly escape dot in RegExp ([0ee7dbb](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n/commit/0ee7dbb))\n* **uf():** remove all thousand separators ([5741270](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n/commit/5741270))\n* **uf():** remove all thousand seperators ([40f549d](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n/commit/40f549d))\n\n### [aurelia-dialog 1.0.0-rc.1.0.3](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/compare/1.0.0-rc.1.0.2...v1.0.0-rc.1.0.3)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* **dialog-renderer:** don't cancel events fix [#281](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/issues/281) ([9a92123](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/9a92123))"}
