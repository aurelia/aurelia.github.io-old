Take it away Shaun...\n\n**Aurelia OpenID Connect** is a distrubuted authorization and authentication plugin for Aurelia. It works as an adapter to the popular open-source [oidc-client-js package from IdentityModel][oidc-client-js]. This blog post commemorates the 1.0.0 release of the Aurelia OpenID Connect plugin. \n\nThe Aurelia OpenID Connect plugin adds distributed authentication and authorization capacities to an app. Whereas authentication testifies to the end-user's identity, authorization testifies to what the end-user can access. [OpenID Connect][open-id-connect] is an internet standard. It extends OAuth's authorization capacities with OpenID's identity capacities. As such, OpenID Connect lets an application answer two questions about its end-users: Who are you? What can you access?\n\nThe Aurelia OpenID Connect plugin is an adapter to the standard-compliant oidc-client-js package. It is possible to use oidc-client-js on its own. What the Aurelia plugin provides is:\n\n1. integration with the Aurelia router\n2. a login/logout component\n3. a navigation filter\n4. a way to observe the state of the end-user\n\nThe 1.0 release of the Aurelia OpenID Connect plugin is ready for consumption in production applications. It has > 95% test coverage, 28 GitHub stars, 34 closed issues (19 are external issues), and several demos in two repositories.
