      <p>One of the exciting things we get to do on the Aurelia blog is share various customer stories and case studies. Sometimes, it's for large, well-known companies like 
<a href="http://blog.aurelia.io/2017/01/18/case-study-nordic-cinema-group/" target="_blank">The Nordic Cinema Group</a>
 but at other times we get to tell the equally-exciting story of a developer who launched their first tech startup.</p>
<hr />
<p>My name is Michal Rutrich. I'm a professional web developer with almost 10 years of experience building corporate web applications using Microsoft technologies - ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC. I've also had the chance to develop a portal from scratch using the Durandal framework.</p>
<p>When Rob Eisenberg released the alpha version of Aurelia, I was fascinated by how easy the development is, how clean the code looks and all the benefits it brings. I decided do give it a try and take it for a spin.</p>
<p>For the last 1.5 years I was a web developer by day and a next-gen-full-stack-open-source ninja by weekends, evenings and nights. I spent literally all of my free time building an app I always wanted and learning the latest trends in web development to accomplish it. It was a roller coaster ride with some serious ups and downs but <em>the greatest professional experience I can recommend to everyone</em>. The application was supposed to be just for my closest family and friends, but during the process I decided to go public, which doubled the effort needed.</p>
<p>I am proud to announce the release of my own startup: <strong>netroStation</strong>.</p>
