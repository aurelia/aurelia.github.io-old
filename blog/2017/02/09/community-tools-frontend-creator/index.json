The tool allows you to group your applications into projects. Within each project you have multiple screens. You are able to drag and drop standard HTML elements as well as custom elements onto the designer surface. You can then configure properties of a selected element using the dynamic property grid.\n\n![Designer](/content/images/2017/01/designer-home-1.png)\n\nEverything is saved as JSON and you have the ability to live preview your changes immediately as well as share links for a given screen with co-workers or clients so that they can interact with your design.\n\n## See it in action\n\nThe following animation shows how little work it takes to rapidly create a screen and preview it live using **FrontEnd Creator**:\n\n![Designer Animation](/content/images/2017/01/frontendcreator-1.gif)\n\nYou also have the ability to edit the HTML directly and see the changes reflected in the designer tab. Finally, you have the ability to preview your changes everytime you save your work or by launching a separate tab and viewing  your changes alone.\n\n![Designer Animation](/content/images/2017/01/frontendcreator-html-1.gif)\n\n## Next steps\n\nCurrently, the **FrontEnd Creator** is in a *closed alpha*. If you are interested in participating and providing feedback, please contact: support@frontendcreator.com\n\nSpace is limited but you will have full access to the application.\n\nFor more information and documentation on using the application, please go here: [Documentation ](https://github.com/mattduffield/frontendcreator/wiki)\n\nWe are striving to make this a first class solution for building web applications.\n\n[www.frontendcreator.com ](http://www.frontendcreator.com)"}
