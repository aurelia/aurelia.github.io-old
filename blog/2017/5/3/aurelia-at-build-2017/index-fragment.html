      <p>If you are attending 
<a href="http://build.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Build</a>
 and are interested in seeing how to combine 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core</a>
 and 
<a href="http://aurelia.io" target="_blank">Aurelia</a>
, you'll want to attend &quot;Getting Started with Aurelia and ASP.NET Core&quot; this Friday.</p>
<p>In this talk you’ll get a crash course on using Microsoft’s tools to build a new Aurelia ASP.NET Core app. We’ll start by creating the project from scratch and then learn how to use Aurelia’s core concepts, all while watching our application update in realtime in the browser as we develop. The session is on Friday at 12pm and is located in Tech Talk B.</p>
<p>We're also having an Aurelia Meetup in Seattle on Tuesday evening. If you are interested in attending, please contact @mobilemancer on Twitter.</p>
<p>Hope to see you at one of these events!</p>
