We will be continuing our effort in this space for the rest of the core modules.\r\n\r\nOne of the packages that recently got an update is `aurelia-testing`. A new version `1.1.0` has been released. With this, it'll be lighter weight and friendlier to bundler. Though if you had an existing application that was created with `aurelia-testing@1.0.0` and the following webpack configuration:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nnew ModuleDependenciesPlugin({\r\n  'aurelia-testing': ['./compile-spy', './view-spy']\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou will see an issue like this when upgrading:\r\n\r\n```\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve './compile-spy' in '~\\app\\node_modules\\aurelia-testing\\dist\\native-modules'\r\n\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve './view-spy' in '~\\app\\node_modules\\aurelia-testing\\dist\\native-modules'\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple way to resolve this is to remove those 3 configuration lines, as they are no longer needed for `aurelia-testing@1.1.0` onwards.\r\n\r\nThanks to [steenburgh](https://github.com/steenburgh) for helping with this issue.\r\n\r\n## Until next time\r\n\r\nAs always, thank you for all the feedback and contribution on both v1 and v2. We can't wait to finally get Aurelia 2 out there into the wild in its more completed form.\r\n\r\nIf you ever have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out.
