Here's Moritz to tell you more about it...\r\n\r\n## What Is RealWorld?\r\n\r\n[gothinkster/realworld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) is a great place to learn new frameworks in the context of a more real-world scenario. It's also good if you want to learn best practices.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to the realworld project on [medium](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5) states:\r\n\r\n> RealWorld shows you how the exact same real world blogging platform is built using React/Angular/& more on top of Node/Django/& more. Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same API spec.\r\n\r\n### Functionality Overview\r\n\r\nThe example application is a social blogging site (i.e. a Medium.com clone) called \"Conduit\". It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication.\r\n\r\n#### General Functionality\r\n\r\n* Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)\r\n* CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)\r\n* CRUD Articles\r\n* CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)\r\n* GET and display paginated lists of articles\r\n* Favorite articles\r\n* Follow other users\r\n\r\n#### General Page Breakdown\r\n\r\n* Home page (URL: /#/ )\r\n\t* List of tags\r\n\t* List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag\r\n\t* Pagination for list of articles\r\n* Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )\r\n\t* Uses JWT (store the token in localStorage)\r\n\t* Authentication can be easily switched to session/cookie based\r\n* Settings page (URL: /#/settings )\r\n* Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )\r\n* Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )\r\n\t* Delete article button (only shown to article's author)\r\n\t* Render markdown from server client side\r\n\t* Comments section at bottom of page\r\n\t* Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)\r\n* Profile page (URL: /#/profile/:username, /#/profile/:username/favorites )\r\n\t* Show basic user info\r\n\t* List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the app covers many basic and advanced topics like Routing, Fetch-API and Authentication.\r\n\r\n## Why Should You Be Interested?\r\n\r\nIf you want to get involved with Aurelia, this project could provide a good starting point for you, whether you're just using Aurelia or if you want to contribute. As Jonathan Eckman has described in his [blog post](https://blog.jonathaneckman.io/contributing-to-aurelia/), it is a goal worth achieving. As mentioned before, this project can also be a good place to discuss and showcase best practices. So far, the code has received quite a bit of review. Finally, this is a good sample if you want to compare different frameworks. Maybe your boss needs a decision on which framework to use, or you just want to learn something new.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI want to thank all who participated in and supported this project: the RealWorld core-team, the Aurelia core-team, my team at `aurelia-realworld-example-app` and the Aurelia community. I can say that the Aurelia community is alive and very supportive!!! If you would love to join in the community in support of this effort, we're considering writing a full tutorial for the Aurelia RealWorld app. Please **star** and reach out to us at [aurelia-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/gothinkster/aurelia-realworld-example-app)."}
