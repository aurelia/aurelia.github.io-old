      <p>Today, I'm pleased to introduce you to Daryl Cober, a member of the Aurelia community who has been building out &quot;Smoke House Project&quot;, a skeleton framework for desktop/web/mobile deployment using Aurelia, including a node Web API and a MongoDB. I'll let him share more about what he's working on and his journey to get there. Take it away Daryl!</p>

<p>Hello all you fellow Aurelia junkies!</p>
<p>Rob invited me to share a few thoughts about my experience working with Aurelia.</p>
<p>I am a seasoned software developer / contractor / consultant (some call me an old goat) with over 30 years of experience under my belt. I literally have &quot;been there, done that, got the t-shirt&quot;. You can find me at

<section><h2 id="choosing-aurelia">Choosing Aurelia</h2><p>Many years ago I realized the need for a simple yet powerful framework for building Single Page Applications (SPAs). Most of my work had evolved into building what we were calling &quot;internet or web enabled applications&quot;. Since the User Interface (UI) was almost always running in a browser, SPAs were the obvious choice.</p>
<p>I tried to build my own framework, with limited success, then I had the opportunity to work on a team using Durandal (Aurelia's predecessor). I was immediately impressed with its ease of use, etc. I was so excited, finally a framework I could use as a base to build up a decent library for my various projects.</p>
<p>I literally just started on a new project using Durandal and along comes Aurelia (still in alpha). I did not hesitate for a moment. I installed the Command Line Interface (CLI) and have been using it ever since. I was hooked!</p>
<p>I had a couple of new projects in the wings and decided I would do a real framework evaluation before I jumped in feet first. Needless to say, I chose Aurelia and have no regrets. (As a footnote - I will mention that I have worked on several projects using Angular and I still feel the same way about Aurelia as I did when I made my decision to choose it as my &quot;go to framework&quot;.)</p>

<section><h2 id="the-smoke-house-project">The Smoke House Project</h2><p>A lot of my clients were asking for applications that could run on the desktop as well as a mobile device. I had worked on various teams building hybrid apps for IOS and Android devices using Cordova (
<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">https://cordova.apache.org/</a>
) and also knew about Electron (
<a href="https://electronjs.org/" target="_blank">https://electronjs.org/</a>
) so naturally I started experimenting to see if I could put together a single code base that would build for any desktop / mobile install.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge was to organize a project structure that would conform with the individual framework requirements so that I could keep the modifications to a minimum. After that I simply had to modify some of the build scripts so that each framework had access to the appropriate files and voila...a simple, single code base that I could build for virtually any type of installation.</p>
<p>The next step was to build a &quot;starter&quot; project to act as a base for developing future applications. I wanted to assemble a collection of default libraries to support running the application in multiple environments. These included libraries to support multi-lingual labeling, touch support, scrolling, authentication and a bunch of other housekeeping functions. I tried to adopt a &quot;Keep it Simple&quot; mantra and also wanted to keep the bundled application as small as possible. I avoided all the &quot;bloat&quot; libraries such as JQuery and Bootstrap, although you could certainly include them if you wanted them.</p>
<p>I decided to post my efforts as an open source project on GitHub. You can find it at 
<a href="https://github.com/SmokeHouseProject" target="_blank">https://github.com/SmokeHouseProject</a>
 I have just completed my first major project using this framework and am preparing to start a new project. It has been a while since I posted this project and I have learned some lessons along the way, so I am currently in the process of updating the framework with my latest code base. I have decided to blog about this process so you can follow along if you are interested. You can find my blog at

</p>
<p>Please feel free to download the project and play. I have tried to document my modifications in the readme files in each directory. Hopefully it helps!</p>
<p>You can reach me anytime at darylcober at darylcober dot com. I welcome all feedback and also would love to have some contributors to my project.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
