<a href="https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld" target="_blank">gothinkster/realworld</a>
 is a great place to learn new frameworks in the context of a more real-world scenario. It's also good if you want to learn best practices.</p>
<p>The introduction to the realworld project on 
<a href="https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5" target="_blank">medium</a>
 states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RealWorld shows you how the exact same real world blogging platform is built using React/Angular/&amp; more on top of Node/Django/&amp; more. Yes, you can mix and match them, because they all adhere to the same API spec.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Functionality Overview</h3>

<h4>General Functionality</h4>
<ul>
<li>Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)</li>
<li>CRU* users (sign up &amp; settings page - no deleting required)</li>
<li>CRUD Articles</li>
<li>CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)</li>
<li>GET and display paginated lists of articles</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Comments section at bottom of page</li>
<li>Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Show basic user info</li>
<li>List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles</li>

<section><h2 id="why-should-you-be-interested">Why Should You Be Interested?</h2><p>If you want to get involved with Aurelia, this project could provide a good starting point for you, whether you're just using Aurelia or if you want to contribute. As Jonathan Eckman has described in his 
<a href="https://blog.jonathaneckman.io/contributing-to-aurelia/" target="_blank">blog post</a>
, it is a goal worth achieving. As mentioned before, this project can also be a good place to discuss and showcase best practices. So far, the code has received quite a bit of review. Finally, this is a good sample if you want to compare different frameworks. Maybe your boss needs a decision on which framework to use, or you just want to learn something new.</p>
