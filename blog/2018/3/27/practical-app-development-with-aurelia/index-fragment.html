      <p>This week we welcome Matt Duffield to tell us about his new Aurelia book!</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484234013" target="_blank">Practical App Development with Aurelia</a>
 is a book aimed at exploring all aspects of the Aurelia framework, including routing, templating, data-binding, components, event aggregation, HTTP services, features, plugins, and more. All this is done in a way that helps you see how to tie all these pieces together to construct an end-to-end application.</p>

<p>Aurelia is a modern front-end framework for mobile, desktop, and web clients. It is standards-based and has a very low learning curve. <strong>Practical App Development with Aurelia</strong> teaches you to use the framework to write line-of-business applications using simple, clean JavaScript. You'll learn the key abstractions of Aurelia and understand the lifecycle of a view. If you want to understand the main features of the framework and gain a mastery of building Aurelia apps, then this book is for you.</p>
