All this is done in a way that helps you see how to tie all these pieces together to construct an end-to-end application.\r\n\r\n![Practical App Development with Aurelia](../styles/images/blog/practical-app-development-with-aurelia/cover.jpg \"Practical App Development with Aurelia\")\r\n\r\nAurelia is a modern front-end framework for mobile, desktop, and web clients. It is standards-based and has a very low learning curve. **Practical App Development with Aurelia** teaches you to use the framework to write line-of-business applications using simple, clean JavaScript. You'll learn the key abstractions of Aurelia and understand the lifecycle of a view. If you want to understand the main features of the framework and gain a mastery of building Aurelia apps, then this book is for you.\r\n\r\n[Practical App Development with Aurelia](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484234013) is available today. You can [order it now on apress.com](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484234013).\r\n\r\nIn addition to today's book announcement, I want to share that I'm considering authoring an advanced book on Aurelia as well. I'm currently gathering feedback from the community. [Please join us on discourse](https://discourse.aurelia.io/t/aurelia-advanced-topics/981) where we are discussing potential topics."}
