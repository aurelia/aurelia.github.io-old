Read on to get the details...\n\n## Aurelia CLI\n\nWe're excited to share that the CLI can now setup Protractor and Jest when choosing to use the Aurelia-CLI internal bundler. This option was already available for Webpack, but can now be used with the Aurelia-CLI bundler as well.\n\nNew Webpack projects now use the mini-css-extract-plugin instead of the extract-text-webpack-plugin. This plugin works better with Webpack 4. The new mini-css-extract-plugin requires a higher version of Node.js, so make sure to update Node.js to at least v8.9.0.\n\nA great many improvements were made by the Aurelia community, which we are very grateful for. These improvements are listed in the changelog below.\n\n## Aurelia Dialog\n\nWe released Aurelia Dialog 1.0.0, basically promoting `1.0.0-rc.2` to 1.0.0. It has been stable for more than a year and we felt it was time to make it official.\n\nFollowing up on that, we've also released Aurelia Dialog 2.0.0-rc.3, which has a few breaking changes:\n\n* The *default resources* (`UxDialog`, `UxDialogHeader`, `UxDialogBody`, `UxDialogFooter`, `AttachFocus`) are no longer re-exported from the *main* module. So if you've been doing something like `import { UxDialog } from 'aurelia-dialog';`, it will no longer work. \n* The *default resources* are no longer statically imported from any of the mandatory modules. Because they are optional, you can now choose not to register them, or just to register some of them using the configuration API. We import them using `import()`. As a result you may need to reconfigure your build setup differently. For example, if you are using the `aurelia-cli` `RequireJS`/`SystemJS` build setup and you are using the default resources, here's a sample configuration for the dialog:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"dependencies\": [\n  //...\n  {\n      \"name\": \"aurelia-dialog\",\n      \"path\": \"../node_modules/aurelia-dialog/dist/amd\",\n      \"main\": \"aurelia-dialog\",\n      \"resources\": [\"resources/*.js\"]\n  }\n  //...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n* All *default resources* are moved under the `resources` folder.\n* The `native-modules` and `es2015` builds are now targeting *esnext* modules; they will contain dynamic imports in the form of `import()`.\n\nThere are a couple of interesting improvements as well:\n\n* Usage of `Origin.get` was removed; we now depend on the built-in support for `class` references from the `CompositionEngine`. What does this mean? Usage of `class` references for *.viewModel* should no longer cause issues with *Webpack* when `PLATFORM.moduleName()` is not used.\n* *default resources* are now registered using `class` references.\n\nOur plan is to promote `2.0.0-rc.x` to `2.0.0` after community feedback on the changes around the *default resources*. Also, since the API is the same as `1.0.0`, excluding the *default resources* re-export drop, we intend to ship fixes only for `2.x`. All work on new features is going on the `master` branch.\n\n* New features (next major) branch - `master`\n* v2 maintenance branch - `v2.x`\n\nYou may see *Issues* and *Pull Requests* with the label `feedback wanted`. Please feel free to check them and drop your opinion if interested. We'd love for you to get involved in the next version of the dialog plugin.\n\n## Aurelia i18n\n\nThe i18n plugin has been fully converted to TypeScript. We've bumped the major version for this release, so we're now at 3.0.0-beta.1. We've made a number of improvements to the core of the i18n plugin as part of this work, some of which resulted in a few breaking changes. Please find the detailed change list below for more information.\n\n## Major Releases\n\nMajor updates may include breaking changes, new features, fixes to bugs and performance improvements.\n\n### [aurelia-dialog 2.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/compare/1.0.0...2.0.0-rc.1)\n\n#### Bug Fixes\n\n* **css:** update styles to use ux- prefix instead of ai- ([f29d8cb](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/f29d8cb)), closes [#306](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/issues/306)\n* **package.json:** add missing dependency ([ed9c5df](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/ed9c5df))\n* **attach-focus:** AttachFocus must be the default export fix [#358](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/issues/358) ([fb5e829](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/fb5e829))\n* **resources:** use named exports instead of default ([4033216](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/4033216))\n\n#### Features\n\n* **attach-focus:** make work as boolean attr ([f75abb4](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/f75abb4)), closes [#349](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/issues/349)\n* **resources:** register resources by class ([#354](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/issues/354)) ([ff55c80](https://github.com/aurelia/dialog/commit/ff55c80))\n\n#### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* **resources:** -
