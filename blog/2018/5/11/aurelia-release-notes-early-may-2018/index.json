Just this week we've released the first set of improvements to the binding engine, which merge the Lexer and the Parser. By doing this we were able to increase the performance of binding parsing by 10x in some cases!\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that this is technically a breaking change to `aurelia-binding` since we've removed the Lexer. However, it's unlikely that anyone used the Lexer directly, since it had little value outside of the Parser, which used it internally. Even though this change isn't likely to cause any issues, we've bumped the major version of `aurelia-binding` to 2.0.0, so you'll need to do an explicit update to opt into the new performance work.\r\n\r\nWe continue to make improvements all along Aurelia's core libraries. This week's releases also include updates to i18n, improvements to the PAL for TypeScript users and a new Card component for `aurelia-ux`.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the full details are below.
