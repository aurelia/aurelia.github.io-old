Let's hear what Patrick has been up to... \r\n\r\nStarting today, developers with no previous Litecoin/Bitcoin experience can begin building decentralized applications (dApps) using a free and open-source project we are calling CoinMesh.\r\n\r\n## What is CoinMesh?\r\n\r\nCoinMesh is a JavaScript-based platform for building applications on top of the Litecoin and Bitcoin blockchains.\r\n\r\nWe look to be the standard way for integrating some of the complex processes needed in a typical application like this and foster a community of building best practices and security in to all aspects of your software.\r\n\r\nWe are launching CoinMesh initially with an Aurelia client-side application and asking for the Aurelia community to take the plunge and learn more about the value of these types of applications and give feedback on the open-source tooling.\r\n\r\n## Why CoinMesh?\r\n\r\nOver the past year and a half, I've run in to a few problems where I found that applications that integrate payment processors are overly expensive and integrating payments using traditional banks is both expensive and slow.\r\n\r\nI started looking in to some alternate methods again like Bitcoin.  If you’re not familiar with what those are, they’re basically an alternative payment form to cash, credit, and checks and are essentially distributed ledgers that keep a record of all the transactions on their respective networks.  People see value in them due to their open-sourced and decentralized nature, which help make them censorship resistant.\r\n\r\nDuring my journey of learning about payments in apps I started looking at Ethereum and realized that the Solidity language is both overly complicated and a poorly written language.  I started looking at Bitcoin and then Litecoin and realized that the security in relying on the most powerful and trustless public blockchains has more value and started trying to build applications on top of them directly.  Unfortunately the tooling was difficult and getting started ended up being a months long affair each time.  As I asked around, I found out I wasn’t the only one who felt this way.  In fact, many dev’s who were interested in dabbling in Bitcoin or Litecoin quit early because of just how discouraging the process was.  This is what inspired me to create CoinMesh.\r\n\r\n### CoinMesh\r\n\r\nCoinMesh is a n-tier platform that provides the architecture for developers to create flexible and reusable applications. By automating the blockchain node, we also make it accessible through an adapter layer.  That means you as a developer can go straight to building out the foundations of your project in a mere matter of minutes. No more hours of trouble-shooting in the dark.  No more scouring community discussion boards for answers.  CoinMesh solves all these problems for you so that you can do what you do best, build and validate your projects.\r\n\r\nIf you’d like a more in-depth explanation behind what CoinMesh does, I invite you to read this [overview of CoinMesh’s technology](https://coinmesh.com/docs/#/overview-coinmesh-tech).\r\n\r\n### A Call for Pioneers\r\n\r\nOne of our goals as a company at BlockFuse is to foster an entrepreneurial, helpful, and active open-source community.  The reason for this is because we are hoping that someone(s) will build the next killer Bitcoin or Litecoin app using our platform.  To be honest, the utility of these two currencies has been limited to just a medium of exchange for goods and services.  However, we believe CoinMesh will be the key that unlocks the floodgates to app development.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I wanted to invite you to be some of the first to [join our slack](https://join.slack.com/t/blockfuse/shared_invite/enQtNDExMzk5NTY1MTIxLWRjYWJjMTNhZTRmOGQ2OTJiZjNlNzIyNWJiMDliZWZlOGQxOGZhYzVhZTliYTU3NzE4MGI3NTM2NzRmOGU1YjY) and try CoinMesh out for yourselves. Be the next wave of pioneers in this emerging field of technology to bring more utility to Bitcoin and Litecoin. The time to empower developers with the necessary tools is now. We will be at the forefront of this. Let’s work together to build, increase, and sustain a censorship resistant future.\r\n\r\n### Connect\r\n\r\n1. [Company Website](https://blockfuse.io/)\r\n1.
