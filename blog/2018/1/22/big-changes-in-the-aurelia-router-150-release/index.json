Though I love running my consulting company [Foursails Technology Group](http://www.foursails.co) and turning my clients' dreams into reality, I have my own dream: I have taken over the development of the Aurelia router and I've decided to dedicate more time to making Aurelia as great as possible. That's why I'm asking members of the Aurelia community who may not have time to contribute code to consider sponsoring my development of Aurelia.

Both contributions come to you due in large part to the hard work of community member [Jürgen Wenzel](http://github.com/jwx)! The first set of features adds a great deal of power and flexibility to view ports, and we're going to take a look at how to leverage these features to build the perfect master-detail page. The second feature exposes enhanced information to the navigation properties of the router.\r\n\r\n## View Port Configuration\r\n\r\nView port configurations have been an effective way to decouple sections of an Aurelia application. Up until now, there has been a restriction that each view port was populated with some kind of page. With 1.5.0, this restriction has been lifted, and there are now a few new ways to leverage view ports that afford greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n### Empty View Ports\r\n\r\nView ports can now be specified as empty. As we will see later, this is extremely useful when [designing for zero data](http://davismj.me/blog/optional-route-parameters/), such as in a master-detail page. You can empty a view port by setting `moduleId` null in the route configuration for that view port.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript app.js\r\n  export class App {\r\n    configureRouter(config) {\r\n      config.title = 'Aurelia';\r\n      config.map([\r\n\r\n        // This tells the Aurelia that the 'users' route empties the right view port.\r\n        { route: 'users', name: 'users', viewPorts: { left: { moduleId: 'user/list' }, right: { moduleId: null } } }\r\n      ]);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### View Port Defaults\r\n\r\nIn fact, `moduleId: null` tells Aurelia to \"use the default module for that view port\", and an empty view port is the out-of-the-box default. You can override this default to load a specific `moduleId` by passing a view port configuration to the router configuration. These overrides can be set individually for each view port.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript app.js\r\n  export class App {\r\n    configureRouter(config) {\r\n      config.title = 'Aurelia';\r\n\r\n      // Again, we tell Aurelia that the 'users' route \"empties\" the right view port.\r\n      config.map([\r\n        { route: 'users', name: 'users', viewPorts: { left: { moduleId: 'user/list' }, right: { moduleId: null } } }\r\n      ]);\r\n\r\n      // However, we specify a special placeholder page when the right view port is empty.\r\n      config.useViewPortDefaults({\r\n        right: { moduleId: 'pages/placeholder' }\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Optional View Ports\r\n\r\nIn addition to the new \"empty\" behavior, we've also added a \"no change\" behavior. If a view port configuration is not defined for a route, the router will skip routing on that view port entirely, leaving the view port untouched. If there is no existing content in the view port, i.e. when the application is first loaded, then the router will load the default for that view port.\r\n\r\n```JavaScript app.js\r\n  export class App {\r\n    configureRouter(config) {\r\n      config.title = 'Aurelia';\r\n      config.map([\r\n\r\n        // Now, since we don't give Aurelia any instructions for the right view port on the 'users' route, Aurelia simply ignores the route.\r\n        { route: 'users', name: 'users', viewPorts: { left: { moduleId: 'user/list' } } }\r\n      ]);\r\n\r\n      // If the user navigates directly to the 'users' route however, Aurelia will populate the right view port with the placeholder page.\r\n      config.useViewPortDefaults({\r\n        right: { moduleId: 'pages/placeholder' }\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Enhanced Navigation Properties\r\n\r\nPrior to version 1.5.0, the router had `isNavigating`, `isExplicitNavigation`, and `isExplicitNavigationBack` properties which could either be observed or could be used in custom logic for special handling. 1.5.0 brings a few additional properties specific to the browser's history:\r\n\r\n- `isNavigatingFirst`: `true` if the router is navigating into the app for the first time in the browser session.\r\n- `isNavigatingNew`: `true` if the router is navigating to a page instance not in the browser session history. This is triggered when the user clicks a link or the navigate function is called explicitly.\r\n- `isNavigatingForward`: `true` if the router is navigating forward in the browser session history. This is triggered when the user clicks the forward button in their browser.\r\n- `isNavigatingBack`: `true` if the router is navigating back in the browser session history. This is triggered when the user clicks the back button in their browser or when the navigateBack() function is called.\r\n- `isNavigatingRefresh`: `true` if the router is navigating due to a browser refresh.\r\n\r\n## Installing the aurelia-router@1.5.0 update\r\n\r\nTo get started with the router update, you'll need to update certain dependencies, based on your configuration:\r\n\r\n### Webpack\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nnpm install aurelia-router@^1.5 aurelia-history-browser@^1.1 aurelia-bootstrapper@^2.2 --save\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JSPM\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nnpm install aurelia-router@^1.5 aurelia-history-browser@^1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### CLI\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nau install aurelia-router@^1.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Perfect Master-Detail Page\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate how powerful the new view port configuration options are, I'd like to take a look at how these tools simplify one of the most common use cases in web applications: The master-detail view.\r\n\r\nTypically, a master-detail view consists of a list or a complex record that has items or subcomponents that need to be modified individually. Typically, both a master view and a detail view each have more than enough information to fill the screen, yet we are interested in the information in both views at the same time, with a focus on the detail view. The question is how to render the master and the detail views side-by-side as seamlessly as possible.\r\n\r\nThere have always been patterns for building this in Aurelia. You might use an optional route pattern and compose the detail inside of the master view, or you might use a child router pattern, which is essentially the same. However, both of these strategies require that the detail view lives within master. This means that if you require your master and detail views to be side-by-side siblings, you're going to have to add some extra arbitrary templating to achieve this. Additionally, both strategies require adding extra code to check whether or not the detail route parameter is present and instructions on what to do if it isn't.\r\n\r\nInstead, let's use the new empty route configuration to define a master-only route and a master-detail route:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript app.js\r\n  configureRouter(config, router) {\r\n    config.map([\r\n\r\n      // This specification says the main view port should be populated with master, the side view port emptied.\r\n      { route: 'master', name: 'master', viewPorts: { main: { moduleId: 'master' }, side: { moduleId: null } } },\r\n\r\n      // And here we specify that when the detail parameter is passed, we should load detail into the side view port.\r\n      { route: 'master/:detail', name: 'master-detail', viewPorts: { main: { moduleId: 'master' }, side: { moduleId: 'detail' } },\r\n    ]);\r\n    this.router = router;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```HTML app.html\r\n<template>\r\n  <h1>${router.title}</h1>\r\n\r\n  <!-- And this is where the feature gets its power. There are no restrictions on how we specify the template. For\r\n    simplicity, I've simply added them side by side here. However, if we had a lot of complex css to our application,\r\n    which is common, we can render the side view wherever it needs to be, and it can exist entirely outside of and\r\n    independently of the main view. -->\r\n  <router-view name=\"main\"></router-view>\r\n  <router-view name=\"side\"></router-view>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe haven't opened up any new doors yet, but we have cut out a few of the old hoops we had to jump through. However, this does allow us to add some extremely simple CSS magic to completely transform the user experience of the application:\r\n\r\n```CSS app.css\r\n  /* We give the body the full screen magic treatment to afford us some greater flexibility to treat the router-views\r\n    as individual windows. */\r\n  body {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0;\r\n    right: 0;\r\n    bottom: 0;\r\n    left: 0;\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    margin: 0;\r\n    padding: 2vh 2vw;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  router-view {\r\n    display: block;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* We fill the screen with the main view port so it can be as large as possible at all times. */\r\n  router-view[name=\"main\"] {\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /* And we fill the right 65% of the window with the side view port on top of the main view port. This gives\r\n    us enough space to display the side content without completely obscuring the main view port. This is particularly\r\n    useful when we want to use the information we've found in the detail view to inform a decision in the master view. */\r\n  router-view[name=\"side\"] {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    top: 0;\r\n    right: 0;\r\n    height: 100%;\r\n    width: 65vw;\r\n    z-index: 1;\r\n\r\n    /* And here's the magic. We use the :empty selector on the side view port to shift it completely off screen when\r\n      emptied, and add a transition for a clean, professional visual feedback to the user. In two lines of css. */\r\n    transition: transform 250ms ease-in-out;\r\n  }\r\n  router-view[name=\"side\"]:empty {\r\n    transform: translateX(65vw);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a minimum of code, we were able to structure our view ports in order to quickly build a clean, animated, ux-optimized master detail page. Of course, this is just a quick example of the kind of opportunities afforded with the new view port configuration feature in the 1.5.0 release of the Aurelia router.\r\n\r\n### <a href=\"http://davismj.me/perfect-master-detail\" target=\"_blank\">Live Demo</a>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://davismj.me/perfect-master-detail\" style=\"height: 600px; width: 100%\"></iframe>"}
