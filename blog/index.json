We also realize that a lot of the work that has been done can easily be missed if you're not watching the GitHub [https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia], so make sure you keep an eye on that one too.","updatedAt":"2021-06-22T05:44:14.511Z","publishedAt":"2021-06-22T05:44:14.511Z","links":{"static":"blog\\2021\\6\\22\\aurelia-2-update-alpha-8","html":"blog\\2021\\6\\22\\aurelia-2-update-alpha-8\\index.html","fragment":"blog\\2021\\6\\22\\aurelia-2-update-alpha-8\\index-fragment.html","self":"blog\\2021\\6\\22\\aurelia-2-update-alpha-8\\index.json"}},{"name":"The Aurelia 2 Alpha Release Is Now Available","slug":"the-aurelia-2-alpha-release-is-now-available","author":{"name":"Dwayne Charrington"},"description":"We are excited to announce that the Aurelia 2 alpha is now ready for download","updatedAt":"2021-03-03T09:42:13.163Z","publishedAt":"2021-03-03T09:42:13.163Z","links":{"static":"blog\\2021\\3\\3\\the-aurelia-2-alpha-release-is-now-available","html":"blog\\2021\\3\\3\\the-aurelia-2-alpha-release-is-now-available\\index.html","fragment":"blog\\2021\\3\\3\\the-aurelia-2-alpha-release-is-now-available\\index-fragment.html","self":"blog\\2021\\3\\3\\the-aurelia-2-alpha-release-is-now-available\\index.json"}},{"name":"The Aurelia 2 alpha is coming","slug":"the-aurelia-2-alpha-is-coming","author":{"name":"Dwayne Charrington"},"description":"As many of you know, we have been hard at work on the next version of Aurelia known as Aurelia 2 for quite some time now.
