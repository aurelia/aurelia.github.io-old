Unlike conventionally published books, you are not buying a completed book, but rather buying a book that is currently being updated with new content every 2 or so weeks with new chapters, typos and other changes. The benefits of this approach are when something new is added into Aurelia or something changes, you can take comfort in knowing the book will always be up-to-date.\n\nBecause this book is for the Aurelia community, you are encouraged to provide feedback on the accompanying Github repository [here](https://github.com/Vheissu/aurelia-for-real-world-web-applications-book-feedback/issues). As you can see, a lot of feedback has been provided from typos right through to content suggestions. So do not be shy if you think the book is missing something, you want some clarification or you spot a spelling mistake.\n\nWhile the book is only currently about 65% completed, you can see a complete roadmap [here](https://github.com/Vheissu/aurelia-for-real-world-web-applications-book-feedback/wiki/Structure) of future planned chapters which are being published in the order listed.\n\nAlthough the applications chapter is planned for second-to-last, you can see a sneak peak of one of the applications you will be building (complete with source code) [here](http://vheissu.github.io/aurelia-book-examples/markdown-editor/) in the form of a fully-featured Markdown Editor using Aurelia.\n\nThe book is [available here](https://leanpub.com/aurelia-for-real-world-applications/) starting from as low as $15, using Leanpub's pay-what-you-want model.\n\n## About The Author\n\nDwayne Charrington is a front-end developer from Brisbane, Australia with a passion for JavaScript and all things web for the last decade and counting. A developer by day, developer by night and developer at all other times of the day, Dwayne loathes talking about himself in third person, but has been known to do so when persuaded from time to time. He has been known to drink a lot of coffee and occasionally goes outside to do things that don't involve sitting in-front of a computer screen."}
