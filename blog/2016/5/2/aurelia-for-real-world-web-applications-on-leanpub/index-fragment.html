      <p>&quot;Aurelia For Real World Web Applications&quot; is for anyone wanting to dip their feet or dive head first into the Aurelia JavaScript framework. The book assumes no previous knowledge of Aurelia or any other JavaScript framework, and aims to be a comprehensive be all and end all resource on Aurelia. The book helps guide you through setting up a development environment, offers advice on structuring your applications and how to build components. At the end of the book you will take all of the knowledge you have learned in previous chapters and build actual working web applications (with full source code provided).</p>
<section><h2 id="about-the-book">About the Book</h2><p>The book is being published on Leanpub and is constantly evolving. Unlike conventionally published books, you are not buying a completed book, but rather buying a book that is currently being updated with new content every 2 or so weeks with new chapters, typos and other changes. The benefits of this approach are when something new is added into Aurelia or something changes, you can take comfort in knowing the book will always be up-to-date.</p>
<p>Because this book is for the Aurelia community, you are encouraged to provide feedback on the accompanying Github repository 
<a href="https://github.com/Vheissu/aurelia-for-real-world-web-applications-book-feedback/issues" target="_blank">here</a>
. As you can see, a lot of feedback has been provided from typos right through to content suggestions. So do not be shy if you think the book is missing something, you want some clarification or you spot a spelling mistake.</p>
<p>While the book is only currently about 65% completed, you can see a complete roadmap 
<a href="https://github.com/Vheissu/aurelia-for-real-world-web-applications-book-feedback/wiki/Structure" target="_blank">here</a>
 of future planned chapters which are being published in the order listed.</p>
<p>Although the applications chapter is planned for second-to-last, you can see a sneak peak of one of the applications you will be building (complete with source code) 
<a href="http://vheissu.github.io/aurelia-book-examples/markdown-editor/" target="_blank">here</a>
 in the form of a fully-featured Markdown Editor using Aurelia.</p>
<p>The book is 
<a href="https://leanpub.com/aurelia-for-real-world-applications/" target="_blank">available here</a>
 starting from as low as $15, using Leanpub's pay-what-you-want model.</p>
