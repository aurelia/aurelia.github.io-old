We had one library that we weren't able to update at that time: aurelia-i18n.\n\nToday we have an update release of the `aurelia-i18n` library. It includes two important changes:\n\n1. We have updated our internal dependency on `i18next` to v2.\n2. We have updated the build process to use Babel 6.\n\nThese changes bump the `aurelia-i18n` library version to `0.5.0`. As usual, per semver, because this is a change to a minor version number, prior to a major v1, this constitutes a breaking change version. As a result, you cannot simply \"update\". Package managers won't give you the latest version because they don't want you to break your code unknowingly. Here's how you can get the latest:\n\n* If using JSPM, `jspm install aurelia-i18n` to overwrite the current version with a new install.\n* If using NPM, change the version of the `aurelia-i18n` package in your package.json file to `^0.5.0` and then run `npm install`.\n\nThanks for your patience as we worked out the last few issues with our i18n library!"}
