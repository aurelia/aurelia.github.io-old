      <p>Today we're pleased to announce the release of Durandal 2.2.0. This release updates Durandal's Knockout dependency and fixes a number of bugs.</p>
<p>If you are currently using Durandal, we hope that you will consider updating to 
<a href="http://aurelia.io" target="_blank">Aurelia</a>
 in the near future. In fact, before 
<a href="http://aurelia.io" target="_blank">Aurelia</a>
 was given its name, it was referred to as &quot;Durandal NextGen&quot;. Aurelia embraces the same principles as Durandal and even adopts the same screen activation lifecycle and basic conventions. However, Aurelia is many times faster, much more powerful and is designed for the modern web. If you love Durandal, you'll feel right at home with Aurelia.</p>
<p>As usual, you can read the detailed list of changes below.</p>
