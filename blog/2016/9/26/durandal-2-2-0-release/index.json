This release updates Durandal's Knockout dependency and fixes a number of bugs.\r\n\r\nIf you are currently using Durandal, we hope that you will consider updating to [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) in the near future. In fact, before [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) was given its name, it was referred to as \"Durandal NextGen\". Aurelia embraces the same principles as Durandal and even adopts the same screen activation lifecycle and basic conventions.
