A long-time feature request of Aurelia's router is to support *optional* parameters. With the `1.1.0` release of the recognizer we now have support for this much-requested feature, thanks to the community contributions of Github member [jods4](https://github.com/jods4). To use optional parameters, simply append a `?` to the parameter name, E.g. `:customerId?`.\n\n#### Path\n\nThe `aurelia-path` library handles all path manipulation and parsing, including query strings. Up until now, we've only supported query strings with the more modern formatting. Thanks to the work of community member [Thomas Schlage](https://github.com/fragsalat) we now also support traditional query string formats. To use traditional parsing, simply pass `true` as the final parameter to any of the query string-related utility methods.\n\n### CLI\n\nWe've had a number of important bug fixes to the CLI. Thanks to all the community members who have been jumping in and helping out with this! We also now support two new features:\n\n* Bundle Revision Numbers - Thanks to the work of Aurelia Core Team member [Andrew Stoker](https://github.com/astoker) we can now generate hash-based revision numbers on any generated bundle.\n* Arbitrary Module Loader Configuration - Community member [Julien Enselme](https://github.com/Jenselme) implemented a way to pass custom module loader-specific config through to the bundling system.\n\nThanks to these community members and everyone who has been contributing to the Aurelia project!
