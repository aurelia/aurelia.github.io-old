      <p>Currently our blog is located at <code>blog.durandal.io</code>. That's a bit odd considering all the content here is directly related to Aurelia. So, we'll be moving the blog to <code>blog.aurelia.io</code> this coming week. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. Thanks!</p>
