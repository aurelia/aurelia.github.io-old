<section><h2 id="talks">Talks</h2><h3>Aurelia: Next Generation Web Apps</h3>
<p>Do you want to see what the future of web development will be like? Are you looking for a simple framework or set of libraries that can help you build complex web or cross-platform apps?</p>
<p>If so, you’ll want to attend this session. We’ll introduce you to Aurelia, a new framework with a rich heritage stemming from Caliburn.Micro and DurandalJS. You’ll learn about the fundamental features of the framework, such as dependency injection, templating, databinding, and routing, while we build a simple application. You’ll leave with all the knowledge you need to get started building your own applications with Aurelia.</p>
<h3>Web Components: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</h3>
<p>The Web is undergoing a massive upgrade. You may have heard much about ECMAScript 2015 and the new language features of JavaScript, but have you heard about what's happening with the DOM? Have you heard about Web Components and how they propose to enable truly cross-library, reusable UI widgets through the extension of HTML? In this talk we'll look at the core Web Components specs and see examples of their usage. We'll find that it's not all roses though and we'll also dig deep into some of the new challenges and problems the current specifications may present us with.</p>
