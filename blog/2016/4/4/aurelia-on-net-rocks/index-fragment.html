      <p>If you are a .NET developer...or really any developer interested in hearing some discussion on Aurelia, check out 
<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1279" target="_blank">the latest .NET Rocks episode</a>
.</p>
<p>What will you hear in this episode? Well, we got to talking about the importance of Convention over Configuration and how Aurelia's approach allows you to write much of your code as Vanilla JS, without unnecessary framework intrusion. We talked about features like our View Engine Pipeline, how you can use CSS Modules, React and even Angular components all together in Aurelia. We even had a short discussion on what's happening with the Extensible Web Manifesto, the CSS Houdini Working Group and future plans for Aurelia such as server-side rendering and Aurelia Interface.</p>
<p>As usual, it was a blast 
<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1279" target="_blank">talking with Carl and Richard</a>
. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
