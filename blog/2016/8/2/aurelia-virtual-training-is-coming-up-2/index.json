The following week we begin the second segment, covering Beginning Aurelia Development. Finally, we'll round the month out with the third and final segment on Intermediate Aurelia Development.\n\nWe've set this up so you can choose from one, two or three training segments, depending on your background, interests and budget. Each segment includes eight hours of training, split into two four-hour sessions, one on a Tuesday and the other on a Thursday. Each day the session will begin at 10am and end at 2pm EDT. These sessions are virtual and will be delivered using webcast technology.\n\n[Please visit the event site](https://www.picatic.com/modern-javascript-and-aurelia) to learn more about the courses including additional details about what topics will be covered in each segment as well as purchase tickets. We hope this opportunity serves you well and we look forward to seeing you (virtually) there."}
