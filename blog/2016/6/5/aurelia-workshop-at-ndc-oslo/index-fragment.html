      <p>Next week at NDC Oslo, Rob Eisenberg will be presenting a two-day workshop titled &quot;Modern Web Applications with Aurelia&quot;. Over the course of two days, you'll cover every major topic in Aurelia development through a combination of both lecture-style learning and interactive, collaborative application building. When you complete these two days, you won't only know how to build applications with Aurelia, but you'll also have a slick application you helped to build as part of the process.</p>
<p>You can find out more
