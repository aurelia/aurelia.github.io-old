      <p>There's a lot happening these days with Aurelia! Conference talks, workshops and user groups are just a few places that members of our Core Team will be helping to spread the word and provide training to developers. Below is a brief list of what we've got scheduled in the next few months. There's more to come too...</p>
<h1>March</h1>
<h4>Workshop: Developing Modern Applications with Aurelia - London - March 31 and April 1</h4>
<p><strong>Rob Eisenberg</strong> and <strong>Tibi Covaci</strong> will be co-presenting a two-day workshop on developing Aurelia apps. The demand has been so high that we've maxed out multiple times. Since Tibi and Rob presented one of the first Aurelia workshops together in Stockholm last year, they've partnered together to accommodate additional students in London. We've lifted the student count to allow 10 more to join for this workshop.</p>

<h4>Presentation: Aurelia - Next Generation Web Apps</h4>
<p>Come join us in this session to learn the basics of Aurelia and get a taste of its simplicity and power. We'll walk through a series of demos showing some unique and powerful capabilities of Aurelia unmatched by other technologies.</p>
<h4>Presentation: Web Components - The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</h4>
<p>The Web is undergoing a massive upgrade. You may have heard much about ECMAScript 6 and the new language features of JavaScript, but have you heard about what's happening with the DOM? Have you heard about Web Components and how they propose to enable truly cross-library, reusable UI widgets through the extension of HTML? In this talk we'll look at the core Web Components specs and see examples of their usage. We'll find that it's not all roses though and we'll also dig deep into some of the new challenges and problems the current specifications may present us with.</p>
<h4>Workshop: Building Hybrid Mobile Apps with Aurelia &amp; Aurelia Interface</h4>
<p>Aurelia is an amazingly simple, yet powerful open source framework for building browser, desktop and mobile applications. In this workshop we'll cover how to use Aurelia, including topics such as: MVVM, Databinding, Templating, Custom HTML Elements, Custom HTML Atttributes, Dependency Injection and Routing. But, we won't stop there. Everyone who attends this workshop will receive a free, one year subscription to Aurelia Interface. What is that? It's a set of UI components, built on Aurelia, designed to help you build mobile apps that look and feel native on their respective platforms. Using Aurelia interface we'll assemble a Hybrid Mobile app that looks and feels native on both iOS and Android devices...with a single codebase and a unified component library.</p>

<h1>June</h1>
</section>

If you're attending NDC (or thinking about it) and couldn't make it to the London Aurelia workshop, this will be another chance to get some excellent training directly from Rob.</p>
<h4>Presentation: Choosing a JavaScript Framework</h4>
<p>In the last couple of years there has been an explosion in JavaScript frameworks. How is a developer or business to make a wise choice? What are the advantages, trade-offs and differences? In this talk we’ll compare and contrast six popular front-end frameworks: Angular 1, Angular 2, Polymer, React, Ember and Aurelia. We’ll look at the same “Hello World” example in each framework so we can see, side-by-side, the differences in development strategy and philosophy. We’ll also discuss how these frameworks stack up against a set of both technical and non-technical key evaluators so that you can get beyond the hype and finally make a solid technical and business decision.</p>
<h4>Workshop: Modern Web Applications with Aurelia</h4>
<p>Over the course of two days, we'll cover every major topic in Aurelia development through a combination of both lecture-style learning and interactive, collaborative application building. When you complete these two days, you won't only know how to build applications with Aurelia, but you'll also have a slick application you helped to build as part of the process.
