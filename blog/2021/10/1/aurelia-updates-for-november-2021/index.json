There are some exciting news that the Aurelia team wants to share with the community.\r\n\r\n## V1 updates\r\n\r\n- A vulnerability issue has been patched in `aurelia-path`, applications are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version of this package (`1.1.7`). For more details, please have a look at https://github.com/aurelia/path/security/advisories/GHSA-3c9c-2p65-qvwv . Thanks [s1r1us](https://github.com/msrkp) for helping with this.\r\n- A new major version of the Webpack plugin has been released to support Webpack version 5. Along with the compatibility with the latest version are better plugin typings support and forward compat refactoring, no more deprecated APIs usages. Some folks have been testing it for some time and it's been working well for them.\r\n\r\n## Open Collective Sponsors\r\n\r\nWe have a new Silver sponsor! Woohoo! Thanks [Movavi screen recorder](https://www.movavi.com/screen-recorder) for the generous support, your logo has been added to our homepage as well as all the blogs. We'd like to extend the thanks to our gold sponsors Hoiga, all previous Silver, as well as Bronze and individual sponsors for the continuous support.\r\n\r\n## Until next time\r\n\r\nAs always, we can't wait to finally get Aurelia 2 out there into the wild in its more completed form.\r\n\r\nIf you ever have any questions or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out. The best place to ask questions is on the [Aurelia Discourse](https://discourse.aurelia.io/) and any bugs or feature requests on [the Aurelia GitHub](https://github.com/aurelia/aurelia/issues).
