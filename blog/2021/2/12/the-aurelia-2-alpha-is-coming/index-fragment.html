      <p>As many of you know, we have been hard at work on the next version of Aurelia known as Aurelia 2 for quite some time now. Despite some obstacles (including an ongoing global pandemic), we are happy to announce we are releasing an alpha version of Aurelia 2 on March 2nd, 2021.</p>
<p>We want to thank the community their continued support and patience throughout the Aurelia 2 development process. We really cannot wait for you to try it out.</p>
<p>While we have done quite a lot to ensure that Aurelia 2 is stable and a few people on the core team have been building apps with it, we do not recommend that you use Aurelia 2 in production just yet.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the team are currently working on some features which will be released post-alpha including; AOT, Aurelia Store, full server-side offering with a rest server and a few other things in the pipeline.</p>
<section><h2 id="what-can-i-expect-in-aurelia-2-alpha">What can I expect in Aurelia 2 alpha?</h2><p>TL;DR quite a lot. Aurelia 2 is a ground-up rewrite that maintains its original identity forged in v1 but is improved in every way imaginable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything that is in the v1 core</li>
<li>First-class support for TypeScript</li>
<li>Ongoing improved documentation</li>
<li>An advanced scheduler</li>
<li>Several new compiler and extensibility points</li>
<li>Out-of-the-box support for; Web Components, Shadow DOM and Constructible Stylesheets</li>
<li>Async lifecycle hooks</li>
<li>Imperative component declaration API's</li>
<li>A native script tag distribution using native modules</li>
<li>A new feature-rich<code>@watch</code> decorator to observe values and other pieces of data</li>
<li>Automatically computed observation without the needed for any configuration or decorator (no more <code>@computedFrom</code>)</li>
<li>Numerous low-level API's to write more performant web applications as well as provide plugin authors with new ways to build plugins</li>
<li>Improvements to Aurelia's Dependency Injection</li>
<li>A test assertion library and Aurelia specific test helpers</li>
<li>An easy to use e2e test setup based on Playwright</li>
<li>Revamped i18n, validation and validation-i18n plugins</li>
<li>A brand new router, including Direct Routing (convention-based zero-config routing)</li>
<li>Lifecycle hook sharing API</li>
<li>Improved composition using <code>au-compose.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There is most likely a heap of other things we forgot about in this list, which is why we encourage you to have a play around with Aurelia when the alpha releases on March 2nd, 2021.</p>
<p>You can expect in the lead-up and the coming months ahead, more blog posts, tutorials and Aurelia content on how you can build Aurelia 2 applications and leverage some of the new API's and features.</p>
