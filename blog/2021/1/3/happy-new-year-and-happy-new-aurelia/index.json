But as we enter 2021 we look forward not only to a better year, but to a better Aurelia because Aurelia 2 is just around the corner!\n\nWe've got the pieces in place now and are currently working on doing some test migrations of v1 apps to v2 and writing docs. As soon as we're sure we can provide a smooth migration experience -- and that looks to be very soon -- we're going to officially release the alpha version.\n\nWe know that many of you have been looking forward to trying out v2 almost as much as you love v1. We have too. And we're _almost_ there now. We've really appreciated your patience so far and we'll see you soon in a solid and smooth Aurelia 2 alpha.\n\nThanks and talk to you again soon!"}
